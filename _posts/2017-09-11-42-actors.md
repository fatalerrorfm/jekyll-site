_Note from Chris:_ I failed to realize this while we were recording, but move semantics should also allow passing a non-ValueSemantical reference type into an actor method — if ownership of some parameter moves to the actor method and previous references become invalid, the actor knows it can use that reference type without anyone else touching it. That’s another way the alternate ownership model pairs elegantly with this actor pattern!
