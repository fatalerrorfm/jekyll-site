<p>This week, Soroush and Chris have two very special guests. Erica Gutierrez and Sara Ahmad were part of last year's summer class at Flatiron School. Since then, they've had a lot of trouble landing junior positions at tech firms. Sara and Erica share their frustrations with the hiring and interviewing process over the last year.</p>
