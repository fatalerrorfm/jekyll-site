<p>In our second episode, we discuss view models.</p>
<p>Chris starts with a bold definition of what they are, and more importantly, what they aren't. Soroush raises some concerns he's had with view models, and Chris explains his approach. Finally, we touch on how reactive programming is related to view models.</p>
