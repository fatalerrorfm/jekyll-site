**“I bet we can talk for thirty minutes about that.”**

Fatal Error is a podcast about software development, hosted by  Soroush Khanlou and Chris Dzombak.

We discuss topics at the cutting edge of software architecture, Swift, and software development best practices.

Fatal Error ended after its fourth season. Even-numbered episodes are available exclusively to our Patreon supporters, who we thank for their support.
