Chris Dzombak
Do you hear that? There's, like, a bird outside?

Soroush Khanlou
Bird? Yeah, I hear it. That's tweeting.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, that's a bird outside my window. Because I don't live in New York.

Soroush Khanlou
I haven't seen a bird in four weeks. Okay, you are kicking this off. Sure.

Chris Dzombak
Hey, everyone. Welcome to Fatal Error. I'm Chris.

Soroush Khanlou
And I'm Sirish.

Chris Dzombak
This week we thought that we would talk about productivity, which is kind of a broad topic, but for a while, Sirous and I had been well, Sarosh has been asking or wanting to talk about how do you decide what to work on when you wake up in the morning? And this is something that I am always thinking about, probably overthinking. It's something that I feel like we'll have different answers since we have different kinds of jobs. And hopefully it's an interesting discussion.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. Part of what gets me excited about this topic is that I know, Chris, you are like a diehard getting things done person. You got the whole Omni Focus set up. You got all your contexts. And I have tried multiple times in the past to get into the whole system, and I can't do it. And so I feel like I'm behind somehow. So I want to talk about that.

Chris Dzombak
No. So two important things right out front. First of all, as of a couple months, a month or two ago, three months ago maybe, I'm not really using Omni Focus anymore. Huge breaking indeed. Big news. Big news. Second of all, it's fine. You're not behind anything. You can organize your life however you want, or you cannot organize your life. It's fine. It's all fine.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. I don't know. I just see people who I respect who do a lot of work, and they're doing the Omni Focus. And every time I try, I just fall flat on my face. I, like, literally bought every version of things, every version of Omni Focus. Things two, things three. And I paid probably $300 for productivity software so far, so I'm as committed as I could be, and the systems aren't working for me.

Chris Dzombak
So I have been using for my to do lists and sort of keeping track of personal projects. I've been using Things recently, which has been working out well, and we can kind of dive into why I made that change. But first of all, maybe I want to hear a little bit more about what you're doing and what you found, what is working for you, and what have you not liked about things or about Omni Focus?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, so the way my current setup works is a lot of it is in my brain. And I know that the idea is that you're supposed to get it out of your brain so that you can put it into a trusted system or whatever. And what I do there is basically I have Things as my primary to do list app, but the only thing that seems to persist in there that I actually do keep up with is a giant list of blog posts that I want to write. And as of things three, I have headers now for like, this post is written and needs to be published. This post needs to be written. This is a good idea, this is a bad idea, whatever. So that's working out pretty well. Nothing. And then I also use Things for reminders because I have something that set up on the first of every month to remind me to pay rent and that actually works really well. Can't seem to put anything else in there and reliably put it in and take it out. So for everything outside of things, I've just been using the Notes app with Checklists, which actually works really well for me. The ability to just make a checklist, add a bunch of items to it really quickly, check them off as you go. I use it for grocery lists. I use it for after I get back from a big trip. I know there's like a bunch of things I need to do to get caught up with my life, so I'll make a new doc for that and that's been working really nicely. And then the last thing that I do is I just do kind of like the brain dump component of GTD, where you just put a sheet of paper down and you just write everything in your brain down on that thing and that becomes my template for the day. And I try to cross off as many things I can on that list. And then the next day I turn the page and I do another brain dump and I start all over.

Chris Dzombak
Okay, cool. That makes some sense.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, that's my basic system. It's been working. It has its flaws because I can't track long term projects, really. The projects live in my brain, and if I'm not somewhere where my notebook is, I have no idea. I'll forget stuff that I've written down.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, those are my two. Have you tried using Notes, like the application as your sort of brain dump thing? Then that would sync and sort of come with you too.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, maybe I could try like one Notes document per project. That's one?

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, maybe you don't even have to like, one per project. Just like if you want to do a brain dump, like just create like, brain dump October 9, 2017 Notes and go from there. You have infinite pages there and that would at least sync and go with you, right?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, that's not a bad idea. I could try that. For me, it's easier to write with the tactility of writing than it is to type on the phone.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, I use Notebooks for really short term. I'm at a desk, like brainstorming, working on something. But if it's anything that needs to be followed up on anything I want to refer to that has to I'll take a picture of it and put it into Bear which is the Notes app that I've been using or put them into things. As to dos because I am not keeping track of paper and lugging it between home and my office and my working space. I'm not lugging that paper between all these places.

Soroush Khanlou
We have a cloud. It more or less works. Just use that.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, well it's more just like I'm not going to remember. Oh, I have to bring this sheet of paper and this I have a notebook that stays with me in my backpack but it's not easily searchable or it's not good for I use it almost as like a temporary storage for things that then get put into the computer.

Soroush Khanlou
Kind of like a GTD inbox?

Chris Dzombak
Kind of. Yeah. Except like a really ephemeral GTD inbox.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah.

Chris Dzombak
Cool.

Soroush Khanlou
There's one other component to the system that I forgot to mention, which is that I am really meticulous about my email inbox. And so if there's an email in my email inbox it means I need to do something about it. I'm either waiting on an event in the next few days and I need reference information in it or I need to reply to it or I need to take some physical action in the world. That system also more or less works for me right now. I have seven emails. I got to get back to some of these people.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, so email inboxes are hard. My email and email inbox, at least my personal one, is kind of a mess right now because I've been just ridiculously busy the last week or two. A lot of it is stuff that I just have to read or skim and then just move on. Some of them are things I actually need replies. It's a sort of classic multiple inbox problem, right? You have your email inbox, you have maybe your inbox and things or your notebook inbox, maybe you have RSS feeds. They're just like I don't know, a bunch of different inboxes that represent things you have to do and putting them all in one place is hard. You can move emails you have to reply to into things and include a link back to mail app. But can you do that? You can. It's kind of a lot of bookkeeping but you totally can do that. Yeah.

Soroush Khanlou
I kind of have always wanted this set up where I just have one inbox of everything in my life. All my emails are in there, all my Instapaper items are in there. My YouTube watch later queue is in there. I can actually add tasks, there's calendar events, there everything's in there and I can just see at a glance like everything. And I don't have to move anything anywhere. It just automatically collates and collects all the stuff and puts it all in the right place and then I can process those items and that's where I work from.

Chris Dzombak
That's the dream. The closest thing that you're going to find is literally email for a while. I went through a phase where I was getting all of my RSS feeds via email.

Soroush Khanlou
That's crazy.

Chris Dzombak
Well, I mean, Gmail has filters. You just shuttle it off to your RSS inbox and read from there. That gets rid of that. You can email things to an inbox to read, but that didn't I forget why, but that ended up not scaling. Well, I think mostly like mobile support for that is kind of shit.

Soroush Khanlou
I suspect there's also like a context issue of like there are certain contexts that I'm in and I mean like GTD context. Ha ha. Yes. But there's context that I'm in that I would want to read instant paper stuff and I don't want to see my fucking emails when I'm reading instant paper.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. So to kind of go for what I'm doing now, let me do this for two minutes and I definitely want.

Soroush Khanlou
To hear why you left Omni Focus and move to Things.

Chris Dzombak
Sure. Yeah. So I'm using Things for my to do lists and keeping track of stuff at both for home and at work. I even have talks that I want to watch, like I have a list in here or project and things like finish watching strange loop videos. I have kind of an ongoing list of read these research papers, read these computer sciencey sort of articles, watch these computer sciencey sort of talks. So I'm using Things for my day to day and long term to do lists. One of the reasons that I moved away from using Omni Focus was that I found myself making day to day to do lists that involved things from Omni Focus, but also involved just offhand things like remember to get my laundry from the dryer. And I'm not going to go through filing that in Omni Focus somewhere. Just appear on a list the way that Things has its Today list. And I can just add items ad hoc to that and it works really well. It lines up really well with the way that I have been tending to work for the last several months for the last year. So I decided just to commit and move stuff to Things and start using Things as I alluded to before. I'm using Bear for notes, things that I like about this, it seems to sync well and reliably supports Markdown. The way that it organizes things with tags is useful. And so I'm putting sort of reference material and that kind of stuff in there. I'm not so much making lists of Things in there because generally lists of action items go into Things. The one exception there is I put together an Apple script so I can have a project template in Bear and then convert that into an actionable project in Things. So, for example, my trip preparation project Checklist now lives in Bear and I can use an Apple script to create prepare for X trip in Things. That works out well. I wish Things had some sort of feature for project templates or checklist templates, because there are a few things like that, right? I have a checklist for going over my personal budget once a month. Right. That's a process that I go through. I have a checklist for hosting a barbecue in my backyard. Right. Remember to buy these things and set these things up.

Soroush Khanlou
Does Omni Focus have support for that?

Chris Dzombak
Not really. The way that people do this in Omni Focus is you can have projects which are on hold or which are dropped, and you use Apple script to make a copy of it and make that copy actionable. But it's all a hack. All of this is hacks.

Soroush Khanlou
Because I remember CGP. Gray said a long time ago that he has a checklist for lots of stuff, but for YouTube videos, for example, and it's like 90 items, and he makes a template for a new video and then checks off all those items as he goes through the process.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, I'm sure it's a similar, like, Apple script hack. Apple script is great. The other thing that I really didn't like about Omni Focus is like, contexts are such a big deal in Omni Focus, and they don't have to be. I guess you could just not use them, but as long as they're there. I found myself wanting to assign context to Things even though I wasn't really using them right. And just being able to have a couple of tags that are actually useful in Things, which maybe aren't context in the pure sense, but I don't know, it's working out well. The other thing to note, I have my shopping list in any list now. So this is where my groceries and my grocery list goes, basically household shopping, because that integrates with the Amazon Echo ecosystem. So I can say thing majig, add whatever to my shopping list, and that works out well. It shows up in this app on my phone and I can go across things off. Previously I was like using Omni Focus for my shopping list and had IFTTT iftta set up to integrate the Amazon ecosystem with Omni Focus, and it was kind of a hack. I still do have a hack that integrates the Amazon Echo to do list with Things via iOS reminders import, which is a total hack, but it works. I can still say add reply to Saroshe to my to do list, and that shows up in Things eventually. So that's fine. I still have too many inboxes. I have email, I have RSS, I have Instapaper, and I have my things inbox where I capture things. I'm tending to use Instapaper more for personal reading and interesting articles than for more programming studying and programming reading, just because when I find that I want to sit down with my phone or my iPad and read an Insta paper. I'm not in a studying kind of mood. If I'm at my computer and I'm like, oh, I have some time, what do I have to read? I'll go to Things and find an article that looks interesting.

Soroush Khanlou
Interesting. And then does Pinboard fit in anywhere in here? Or Pinboard is just saving for long term sort of reference.

Chris Dzombak
Pinboards. Exactly. I'm just saving things for long term reference Pinboard. Has some read later functionality. Like everything has read later or watch later functionality. I think the trick to sanity is not using that in every place because then you have like 30 different read later or watch later lists.

Soroush Khanlou
They're all in boxes, right?

Chris Dzombak
Yeah.

Soroush Khanlou
Inboxes drive you crazy.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, no, they totally, totally do. Yeah. For videos on YouTube or Vimeo or whatever, I'll just add them to Instapaper and then pull them out of Instapaper later. Or the other thing that I'll do is I do use the YouTube or Vimeo Watch Later lists. But only when I'm like, oh, I want to watch this thing from Instapaper or from things on my Apple TV and so on my computer or on my phone, go to be like, open it in YouTube, see watch later and then go find it in YouTube on the Apple TV. Because there's no good way to get videos to your Apple TV.

Soroush Khanlou
Got you. So the YouTube app has a way to basically say, look at my watch later list.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah.

Soroush Khanlou
Got you. Nice. I knew I asked the right person about this productivity stuff because you've got a lot of good systems going on here. I like this a lot.

Chris Dzombak
So important things to recognize here. Like what I'm saying right now is what is more or less working for me right now? I'm still not perfectly happy with it. That's not to say that it necessarily will work or should work well for you, sirous, or you the listener. There are all sorts of different ways to organize your things or not organize your things, and whatever works for you works for you, and that's fine. But yeah, hopefully at least listening to people talk about what they do maybe gives you ideas for things that you might want to change. I think about this stuff way too much. Really. The only thing that I'm not happy with in this setup right now is the number of inboxes. Partly because right now there are too many RSS feeds in my RSS reader. And I'm not sure what to I kind of feel like maybe I should just go in and delete everything and start from scratch.

Soroush Khanlou
I think that's a really bad idea given the way I use RSS, because for me, I use RSS specifically for things I know I like to read. And they may not post very frequently, so they're very out of sight, out of mind. So sometimes a post will come up from someone who posts once every six months. If I deleted everything. I would never find that blog again.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, I guess that's true. There's so much in there now that I basically for the last several months, I've just been kind of ignoring my RSS reader because it just seems like an insurmountable mess and that's not good.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. Obviously, Mark All is read and then it may be worth if you see a post you don't like. Should make a mental tag of like, hey, that RSS feed is just not that valuable.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, maybe.

Soroush Khanlou
I also really like to get rid of blogs with multiple authors. If it's like Life hacker, they just post way too many times. But The Verge, I know people who subscribe to those RSS feeds and it's like, that's a way to drive yourself insane.

Chris Dzombak
Oh, yeah, no, that's horrible. Don't do that.

Soroush Khanlou
I mean, high volume RSS feeds just don't work, at least for my sort of RSS.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, and maybe that's part of it. I'm subscribed to some fairly high volume RSS feeds.

Soroush Khanlou
Kill the high volume stuff and I mean, there's no way to know who's the high volume people but you'll figure it out.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah.

Soroush Khanlou
Okay, interesting. I think I'm going to try breaking up my Notes app into one section for reference because you can make folders now, too. So I'm going to make one folder for reference, one folder for projects. Each project will be its own Note and it'll have its own to do list and any other comments that I want to add about it. I'm like, hey, don't forget to do this part or paste the link or anything that's useful. And then when that project was the archive, that's when it's done or that's when it's matter anymore. That way I can keep track of long term projects, but also have the free form flexibility to just write whatever I want to write about the project. The other thing that happens to me also is things will fall out of sync with reality, which I really hate. So it'll be like, oh, you're like, oh, I'm planning this trip. I'm going to Italy for Pragma next week. I'm planning this trip to Italy and it says, like, buy a ticket to Milan. And then some other stuff comes up and it turns out that the ticket that you need to buy. Actually, you do need a non stop flight to Verona, or stop with some flights to Verona, but you don't want to go straight to Milan. So then the need of that to do item has changed, but I don't change the text of the item. And so I look at it and then I get sad because I know it says the wrong thing. I know what the real thing is. My brain is now thinking about the real thing and it's like I could just change the text, but I don't just change the text. And I don't know why I don't update.

Chris Dzombak
I totally get that. I want to go back to your long term projects thing, too. But a few notes on this. First of all, maybe the solution is then when you're adding items to your to do list, maybe just write like, buy tickets. That's a fine action item, right, and that means, okay, you have to buy tickets. That leaves you open to figure out where where you're flying to, right, and maybe like, an item earlier on the to do list is like, nail down exactly where and where I'm going and when I'm going there.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, well, that's actually a really good example. I'll write, like, nail down where I'm going and then things will come up and I'll figure out where I'm going, but then I won't update that to say, okay, now I do know where I'm going.

Chris Dzombak
It can still say buy tickets.

Soroush Khanlou
Right?

Chris Dzombak
What I'm trying to say here is that the buy tickets item shouldn't imply figure out where I'm going and buy tickets. You should have, like, figure out where I'm going and buy tickets. And you don't have to, neither of those have to be that specific because your brain will I don't know, when you go to buy tickets, you can look at your calendar, look at your brain and be like, okay, yes, this is where I'm going to be.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, that makes sense.

Chris Dzombak
I think part of this, too is just reducing the friction in your use of this tooling. So why are you not going in and updating things to reflect reality? Is it because it's a tool that you find kind of clumsy to use? Is it because you have too much unactionable cruft cluttering up the area, this tool, where this project is? I don't know why? I don't know. There are any number of reasons, but thinking about that could be valuable.

Soroush Khanlou
I think I have the problem that reviews in GTD are meant to solve, right? Every day, ideally, and every week, I should be going through and updating everything to reflect reality, but I just don't. And that's part of the reason that this system has never worked for me. Part of it is cruft. If I look at my things, I have a project for a client that I don't work on anymore. I have a project for a website I wanted to start a year and a half ago that I never did. Spin up new Rackspace instance that has a working Ruby Pick Wiki software. Yeah, I just don't know why do I do this to myself? And then I have this anytime thing that change all passwords in one password, that have a watchtower alert that's really good and I really should do that. Make a dentist appointment. So I just have problems up and down the hall to do stuff.

Chris Dzombak
You really should make a dentist appointment.

Soroush Khanlou
I really should make a dentist appointment. This has probably been in here for, oh, it's a repeating every six months. That's great. That's not going to cause any problems.

Chris Dzombak
Your dentist should just call you and bug you to make an appointment.

Soroush Khanlou
I know, but I hate that.

Chris Dzombak
Okay, fair enough. Yeah, I mean, part of that is just like discipline. Part of it is like, I guess go in every once in a while and clear out things that that you're not gonna end up doing. I am never good about doing reviews either until like every once in a while, I go in in anger and I'm like I'm just like, oh, there's so much stuff in here. I had to delete this and delete this and delete this, and then it more or less reflects reality. Again, a part of it too, is that I, with Omni Focus, tended to put too much stuff in here. So I'm trying not to do that now. Things like list of movies that I might want to watch are like, I just have running movies list in Bear. Right? Yeah. And also because that stuff, it's like I'll remember if I want to watch a movie, and if not, I'm not that big of a movie or TV person. I don't care if I forget to watch a movie that someone recommended because I don't attract somewhere. I don't actually care about that at all.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, that's fine.

Chris Dzombak
Let alone enough to, like, formally track it in a system.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, that's actually, by the way, another inbox is the Netflix My List. Because you can add stuff to that. And that's absolutely another inbox.

Chris Dzombak
I also don't use that. There's that there's Hulu. I don't understand how Hulu works anymore. Their Apple TV app has started surfacing things that I'm not watching and telling me, rewatch this episode. And then I scroll down several items and it's like, oh, there are new episodes of this show. Why is it not on top? So the whole tracking of movies and TV feels very messy for me right now. My solution for that is just to accept that I don't really care about this.

Soroush Khanlou
Right.

Chris Dzombak
And if I at some point remember, oh, yeah, what's going on in Brooklyn 99? I'll go and watch a couple episodes when I have time. That's them. And if I don't remember to do that, then who cares? I'll either remember that it's a thing that I like it, or I'll forget about it. And that's fine, right.

Soroush Khanlou
It's pretty low cost to forget, right? You just don't care.

Chris Dzombak
And like Game of Thrones or Rick and Morty, I'll remember, oh, yeah, there are new episodes of these on Sunday, and I can't wait.

Soroush Khanlou
I will actually recommend for this there's an app called Next Episode, and it's also a website called Next Episode. And you just put in your favorite TV shows, and it'll send you a push notification the night anything airs.

Chris Dzombak
Can I get emails instead?

Soroush Khanlou
That's actually a good question. You might be able to.

Chris Dzombak
I don't mean push notifications.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, push notifications is another inbox honestly. But I like that because it's like when the show comes back, like, okay, flashes back like, time to watch that, it'll send me push notifications so I don't have to worry about it, which I do actually like.

Chris Dzombak
That does sound good. Maybe that's a solution to this problem. But I don't know. I could also just not care about it.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, no, I mean, that is absolutely a solution too. I think it's also like it reflects we're talking about reflecting reality. If you don't care, you don't care. That is the reality that it reflects.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, there are just like so many things that are more important in my life and so many things that I would rather spend time on that like.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, so what if we built an app? All right, let's build an app that just has every inbox in it. And then you can add rules such that if something comes in from a certain source, you could tag it with a specific context and then you could filter down this inbox by context. So things that come in through this email address are flagged as work, whereas things that come in through this email address are maybe not necessarily flagged as work, but they are flagged as email. Things that come through instant paper are like flagged as mental wind down. Things that come in through YouTube are like watching things and Netflix watching things.

Chris Dzombak
That sounds potentially interesting. That sounds like a lot of work.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, well, so the idea would be if you could build this app, then you would never tag anything manually and you could just go into this app and click in these various contexts of like, I just got some food, I'm in the mood to watch something. Click it. And then it would just show you everything that you want to watch. Maybe sort of by length or sort of by whatever.

Chris Dzombak
And that's interesting. I think that you assume a lot in those. I think that those rules are going to turn out being very complicated. For example, a lot of emails I get at work require no action. Some are not high priority. Some have to be dealt with pretty much immediately.

Soroush Khanlou
Right.

Chris Dzombak
Things that I had to Instapaper maybe actually videos to watch. I guess Instapaper knows about videos, so that's fine. But what if I use Instapaper not just for mental wind down kind of reading, but also for papers that I want to read, which I don't. I put those in things. I don't really understand why, but it's working for me. Right? Those rules are going to have to be able to take a lot of context into account to be actually useful.

Soroush Khanlou
Well, the idea would be that the user would be able to program them in.

Chris Dzombak
I feel like you'd have to put in a lot of work both as a developer and as a user, to make it so that this is not just another. Thing that doesn't reflect reality.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, that's definitely true. Yeah, it's tough. The reflecting reality is really the part that gets me. I just want something that knows about the world.

Chris Dzombak
I know, I get that the dream.

Soroush Khanlou
With these smart fridges has always been they would know what's in the fridge and what you need to get, and that has completely not materialized. But that's the way it should be. I should be able to say, yeah, no. Do we have milk?

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, we're not there yet, but maybe someday.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah.

Chris Dzombak
Especially as we work toward that world. I feel like integration between different systems is going to become such a pain point. Like already you're talking about integrating Instapaper, which itself deals with a multitude of websites on the Internet, with whatever smart fridge, with email, with multiple email providers. Right. With RSS, with a bunch of different TV providers. And presumably you have some way to sync up your Netflix queue here so there's like some in depth and there's.

Soroush Khanlou
A lot of APIs that be missing to actually make something like this work.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah.

Soroush Khanlou
And what if you don't use instant paper, you use pocket. Now you're dealing with two APIs to provide roughly the same data.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah.

Soroush Khanlou
You want to know a really fun thing? Before there was like, Instapaper integration into everything, and especially before the share sheet, I used to use Twitter faves to mark things that I wanted to look at later. Like if I was on the subway and there was a picture that looked like it could be funny, I would fave it and then go back later. Like every few days I'd go back through my faves and read all the interesting things and look at all the pictures and then unfave the ones that I did actually want to save long term.

Chris Dzombak
I think you're not the only person who's done that. Also, did Twitter faves work offline and sync up when he got back to the Internet?

Soroush Khanlou
That's a good question because I know they do now, but I don't know if they did back then.

Chris Dzombak
I think a lot of people, especially iOS developers who have not lived in New York under think how well their applications actually need to handle offline support.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. The other thing I've been hitting a lot of is when I'm traveling, I have T Mobile, which is good because it gives you free international, but it's very slow data. So you think your app is good, try it with like 10 bandwidth.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. And remember that people in other countries often have much smaller mobile data caps.

Soroush Khanlou
For sure. Yeah. Stuff.

Chris Dzombak
So that's productivity.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, this is useful for me. I hope our listeners got something out of it. But yeah, I think I'm going to try a couple of these different strategies and maybe I can get a system that works. Most of all, I want things in one place. But I don't know, I'll just I'll figure it out. Maybe we'll do a follow up or something.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, I mean, things in one place is hard. Multiple inboxes are hard. I mean, despite my best efforts, I still have things email RSS and Insta paper. Right. And if I cared about movies and TVs, I'd have more movies and TVs. I would have more inboxes than that. And I don't know what to do about that. Right. That's where I am.

Soroush Khanlou
I'll figure it out. I'll get somewhere.

Chris Dzombak
The other thing is just to realize you may not get somewhere perfect. And the important thing is having something that works for you, not something that productivity experts on the Internet think is great.

Soroush Khanlou
That's right.

Chris Dzombak
Which I feel like doesn't get mentioned enough.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. I think my system works, more or less. Okay. I think there's some changes I want to make. How about your system? You think your system is good? Are there changes you want to make to your system?

Chris Dzombak
I think it's working pretty well. Like I said, I feel like I need to find a way to make RSS more useful, which I think is a combination of really weeding out some of the stuff that I'm subscribed to and of making more of a habit of actually opening that app and checking it. I wish that I did have a better way to track movies and TV stuff in a very low commitment manner. I will look at this service that you mentioned, but who knows if I'll actually stick with it.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah.

Chris Dzombak
The number of different streaming services and everything is too many. It's such a mess and it's just such a ball of complexity that I just don't know how to deal with.

Soroush Khanlou
This isn't even touching the fell off the back of the truck workflow, which is its own whole thing.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. Although if you're in that world, you should absolutely use Plex. It's a wonderful piece of software.

Soroush Khanlou
I do use plex. For a while, I had Plex where it would automatically pull things off the back of a truck when they would air. So, like, a TV show would come out and it would automatically download and add itself to Plex and be ready to watch. I would just turn on my TV and the new episodes would be there and I would just hit play.

Chris Dzombak
That's kind of cool.

Soroush Khanlou
It was really good. Those are the juice. And then it broke and I can't get I haven't been able to get it fixed, like, six years. There's probably things two projects for this somewhere in the bowels of things.

Chris Dzombak
Well, on that note, I don't think I have anything else to add.

Soroush Khanlou
No, me neither. This was helpful. I'm going to try to implement some of this stuff and get back to you.

Chris Dzombak
Okay. Yeah. I'll be curious to hear what ends up working for you or what changes you end up making.

Soroush Khanlou
As always, Chris, great to talk to you.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, absolutely. It's good to talk to you too. And as always, thank you very much to you, our Patreon supporters, for making this podcast possible and helping us get new mics that sound a lot better. We really appreciate it.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, you all are the best. Talk soon. Bye.
