Speaker A
And I was like, that's fine. I can work with that.

Speaker B
I feel like that's a that's a fairly standard, like, employment agreement kind of clause.

Speaker A
Don't compete with us. Seems pretty reasonable.

Speaker B
And and it seems reasonable, right?

Speaker A
Yeah. And so they ended up changing it. I ended up signing it, and then later I heard that I was the first employee of all of their employees to send the contract back with anything.

Speaker B
To be changed, really?

Speaker A
That's every single person just signed it.

Speaker B
That's kind of surprising. But not that surprising, right? I guess there's a tendency, especially before I read this article, to assume, okay, this is your standard employment agreement. I take this or leave this. But again, all of this is malleable.

Speaker A
Yeah. Everybody who gives you a contract is going to tell you it's standard. It doesn't mean it is standard. The standard is what you signed.

Speaker B
Right. Or even if it is standard, like, well, okay, we got this far in the process. Is this worth blowing up this deal over?

Speaker A
Yeah, that's another good counterintuitive. Thing is, if you want to hear the rest of this episode and all of our even numbered episodes, you can subscribe to our Patreon.
