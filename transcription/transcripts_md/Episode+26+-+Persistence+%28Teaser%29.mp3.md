You can also create relationships between, not just entities in Yap database. So you can have a relationship between two things in your database that say, like when this object gets deleted, like, this other object should be deleted, and it's almost like a reference counting sort of relationship. But you can do that between or from things in Yap database to files on disk.

Speaker UNK
Weird.

Speaker A
So you can say this entity in Yap database owns or is the parent of or has a relationship to this file on disk. And so when you delete that entity from Yap database, that file on disk goes away. So.

Speaker C
Like, a concrete example of that.

Speaker A
Would be if you have a Tweet.

Speaker C
Object in your database and you tie it to some piece of media, like.

Speaker A
A photo that it's.

Speaker C
Attached to, when.

Speaker A
You delete the Tweet.

Speaker C
It'Ll also delete the photo.

Speaker A
