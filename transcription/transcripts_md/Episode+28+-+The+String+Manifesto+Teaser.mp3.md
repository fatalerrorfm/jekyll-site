Swift is Swift string, and like, string in general is kind of a minefield of performance anyway. Maybe they just don't care.

Speaker C
Well, so as you were saying that, I realized that they don't say that swift that string will become a by a Random Access collection anywhere.

Speaker B
Right. It becomes a bi directional collection, which I found weird. I thought it would probably be a regular collection before it would be a bi directional collection.

Speaker C
I mean, you can still walk forward and back in, what, linear time, right?

Speaker B
Well, but you can't walk backwards because let's say you start with a character that's one byte, and then you want to go back one character. You don't know how many bytes that character is going to be before you.

Speaker C
Is it possible for it to just keep walking backward until you I guess.

Speaker B
It'S hard to tell where complete a character. Yeah, you wouldn't know. But they do talk about string being bi directionally. Iterable I guess, and I don't know why that is. That stuck out to me as kind of odd.

Speaker C
Yeah, that definitely is odd. I'm realizing that my understanding here I was assuming that they were making a Random Access Collection, which right, just doesn't.
