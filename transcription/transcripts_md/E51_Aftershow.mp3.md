Chris Dzombak
I think that was a good episode.

Soroush Khanlou
I think so, too.

Chris Dzombak
And I forgot to mention, I feel like you should keep your banking information probably in one password, not in notes.

Soroush Khanlou
Well, the routing number is public.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, and the account number is public, too.

Soroush Khanlou
Anybody you give a check to has both of those.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. So why don't you post a picture of a check on the Internet?

Soroush Khanlou
Great point.

Chris Dzombak
Um, no, I'm gonna just I mean.

Soroush Khanlou
It'S also encrypted and it's also file.

Chris Dzombak
Vaulted and it's that's fine. But yeah, I'm looking forward to a Gary the privacy routing number.

Soroush Khanlou
But yeah, routing numbers are like, you can know that I use Chase Bank.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, no, totally. I mean, the other thing is, presumably your account number is in one password, so why not keep the routing number next to the account number? All right, let's just move on from that.

Soroush Khanlou
Moving right along. Yeah. My account number and routing number are in notes.

Chris Dzombak
Okay.

Soroush Khanlou
Whatever.

Chris Dzombak
So banking information is one of the bank information is a little iffy, but stuff like credit card numbers is honestly, that is maybe the piece of, quote unquote, secret information that I care the least about because we have pretty well tested and very commonly used avenues in the banking and legal systems to deal with that. Last week, I parked my car and I was with one of my friends, and I use the little app to pay for parking, which you can do. So I put in my number and I have my credit card saved in this app. And my friend's watching the deal, he's like, oh, your credit card number saved in there? Yeah, who cares? It literally does not matter if this credit card number gets stolen, because my credit card company will say, hey, did you spend $700 at 711 in Texas? Like no, I didn't. I'll get a new credit card.

Soroush Khanlou
It's fine.

Chris Dzombak
Of the things that can get stolen, credit card numbers are like the frankly, it's not that they're not valuable, but pretty chill. Unlike, say, your Gmail account password. We have a system in place to deal with credit card numbers getting stolen, and it works.

Soroush Khanlou
Well, you're just rat fucked if your Gmail password gets stolen, right?

Chris Dzombak
If my credit card number gets stolen from Joe Schmo's Pay for Parking app, it doesn't matter at all. It really doesn't anyway. And bank account numbers are more serious. You're going to have to deal with your bank. But what I really want is I.

Soroush Khanlou
Want a way because you know how Apple Pay will generate a new credit card number for every transaction?

Chris Dzombak
Yeah.

Soroush Khanlou
I want a way for me to just do that from Miamx.

Chris Dzombak
Some credit cards do that. So the credit card that I use most often actually has this service. You can generate a temporary account number. You can set a time limit and money limit.

Soroush Khanlou
That's fucking awesome. Or like a payee limit. Like, you could say, only allow it to be charged from verizon and coned.

Chris Dzombak
And now you can't do that.

Soroush Khanlou
But that would be another good feature.

Chris Dzombak
Maybe it would be. I think that the time limit and money limit are easier to implement.

Soroush Khanlou
Right.

Chris Dzombak
The thing that you have to watch out for is if you go to a hotel, they'll ask for the credit card to use to make the reservation. And I think if you used a temporary account number, you'd probably be well, I don't know, you could probably just give them another credit card and say, here, take this money instead. But yeah, I think this used to be more common and I think that fewer credit cards offer it now and I'm not sure why. I feel like it might be fraud related, but I have no evidence to back that up.

Soroush Khanlou
Sorry. Say I think a fewer credit cards.

Chris Dzombak
I think fewer credit cards offer this account number thing now. I feel like it used to be more common and I think that it may be fraud related, but I'm not totally sure.

Soroush Khanlou
I think fraud detection has gotten much better in the last like five years.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, it used to be really bad.

Soroush Khanlou
You should pop all the time.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, I used to get false positives on my credit cards often. Like really? Have you not realized by now that I spend a lot of money with Apple?

Soroush Khanlou
Even disciplinary machine learning really should be able to get this right.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, no, they seem to have gotten better. The last time I went on an international trip, like half of my credit cards that I called were like, yeah, you don't need to tell us that you're traveling. Nice. I'm not sure why, because I only used one of those credit cards to buy plane tickets. I don't know how anyone else would know that I was traveling to the Middle East.

Soroush Khanlou
Right, that is a good point. Maybe they track you from the app or something. That'd be funny.

Chris Dzombak
Maybe. I mean, it's possible. I have all the apps on my phone.

Soroush Khanlou
I'm also switching to Twitter lists, so that could be a whole ups.

Chris Dzombak
So many feelings about this. I tried that, but it's too much work. I'm not going to go to all these lists to check out. So right now my Twitter is just a total mess.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah.

Chris Dzombak
What I'm going to do is delete most of my lists and unfollow people who I don't like. Basically I would like to refocus to people who I know or care about personally and less sort of commentators and news and that kind of thing.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, I agree with that. What I'm trying to do is I'm trying to do something where I have a Twitter timeline that I check and then all the other bullshit that I don't care about. I could just check when I'm bored, but I don't know if it's going to work out.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, I've spent some time putting things in lists, putting people in lists, and found that I now just never check those lists. I never contact Switch.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, it's a real something.

Chris Dzombak
That's all I've got. I'm going to write down notes about this bread before I forget them all so that I can compare them to what I do next.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, I have so many tips and tricks on the bread.

Chris Dzombak
I thought that you might yeah.

Soroush Khanlou
So it would be kind of cool if it was, like a running segment of, like, how's your bread doing?

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, just we'll check in every once in a while.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, cool. I'm down for that. I'm making a tech list right now.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, see, you're never going to contact Switch to that.

Soroush Khanlou
That'd be really bored. You don't know me.

Chris Dzombak
That's it. Okay. Every week, repeat end, and part of.

Soroush Khanlou
The Twitter list thinking is that I can make I can make a Twitter list for all the funny politics people that I like. They tweet too much to actually follow.

Chris Dzombak
And then you can forget about it and never check that list.

Soroush Khanlou
Well, I've actually been checking it more than my real Twitter list because it's actually funnier.

Chris Dzombak
I just never checked my I just never checked those lists.
