Chris Dzombak
Hey, sir. How's it going?

Soroush Khanlou
Not bad, not bad. It's early.

Chris Dzombak
It is, it is. And I was at karaoke last night for like 4 hours, so we're gonna see how my voice does.

Soroush Khanlou
Nice.

Chris Dzombak
It was a lot of fun. And yeah, I always used to I used to just totally hate karaoke. Like, oh my God, you want me to, like, go sing and in front of a bunch of people with a microphone? This seems like the thing that I least wanted to do. Right, right. And then over the course of a year, several months, my friends dragged me out to karak a few times and it's like, oh, it turns out that this is fun and I can totally do this and it's fine. And everyone else is doing this and it's all like, everyone's just having fun. I should open up the slack too. But so it took just a little bit of time and practice and doing the thing to get over self consciousness about doing the thing and some just like, mental work around having this self confidence to just go do karaoke with people. Right. Which I think is a nice segue for a thing that we wanted to talk about today. See what I was doing here.

Soroush Khanlou
All right. I like it.

Chris Dzombak
So. I think you may remember I mentioned to you a week or so ago that I had lunch with one of our listeners who's in Ann Arbor here and got in touch with me and wanted to get lunch. And talk about some software development related stuff but actually more software team related stuff and team dynamics and impostor syndrome and starting a new job and getting used to the software development world coming out of undergrad or out of your class or whatever education experience you have. And I don't know if that's something that we've talked about before, but I think it's something that could be really helpful for us to talk about. Does that sound like a good topic for you?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, I'm definitely down for it. How long has this person been programming for?

Chris Dzombak
About so programming in general for a few years, it seems like. I don't remember exactly, but they just graduated from undergrad a few months ago and started their first out of college programming job. Got you a month ago at the time that we had lunch and talked about this. So there's a whole lot to deal with. I don't know when's the last time that you started a whole new job? Or do you remember any of the stuff that you experienced or that you were thinking about when you started a new job, especially when you're newer to programming?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, I remember some of it. It was maybe six years ago at this point, quite a while ago. But I do remember some of those feelings and I think some of those feelings pop back up when you learn a new stack. Like when I was messing with the Android stuff, but also it's not quite confidence, but you know, the path through which you're learning is going to go, you know, it's going to start out with you being like, I don't understand any of this. I can't do anything.

Chris Dzombak
This is terrible. Everyone here is so much better than me.

Soroush Khanlou
Right. How does anybody do this at all?

Chris Dzombak
Nothing makes sense.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. And then eventually it ticks into, okay, well, I could do some small things and I'm crawling and then I'm walking and then I don't think with the Android stuff I've gotten running yet, but with each stack or with each thing that you learn, you kind of get there.

Chris Dzombak
Totally. Yeah. And I mean, that's one of the things that we mentioned. I think this person was starting a new thing and working a new stack and a month in. I feel like it's important to call out, like, you're not going to be an expert and I don't think anyone is expecting you to be an expert on a new stack. Like a month in, especially a month in at a new company, the new stack and everything, you're still going to feel totally or at least I will still feel like, totally lost and I don't really know what's going on at all. And that's totally fine. I don't know how long it would take you typically to get into like, okay, I know how this team works and how this company works. I know the stack works, I know how our code base works, but that is months and months and months of effort for me.

Soroush Khanlou
So you started your new job last June, right?

Chris Dzombak
I think it was May, but yeah, it was right around then.

Soroush Khanlou
And you had a pretty different, like you moved from doing iOS at the Times with kind of a reactive paradigm all the way over to now I'm doing Python and writing Go and stuff like that. So that was like a pretty big shift as well. How long before you felt productive?

Chris Dzombak
I mean, a long time. I mean, I started this in May, and I think it was probably like July or August before I really started feeling like, okay, I understand how this team works. I understand how we're organizing stuff. I understand how the different parts of this system work. I understand how to make changes to any of these code bases in a way that I actually understand. There's still things that I'm learning about, like Python, despite the fact I've been writing Python, ostensibly for we're coming up on a year here in a few months. There's just so much and I've been doing the software development thing for a little while now. Right. So this is even more overwhelming for someone who's, like, you're just coming out of undergrad or just coming out of a boot camp or just starting a new has just made a switch to a programming career somehow. There's a lot there. So I guess the takeaway for this little bit is it's going to take a while for you to feel like you know what's going on, you're contributing, and that's totally okay and expected, and no one is expecting you. To come in and like a month in, be like and be an expert on Stack and on the Code Base and be making giant changes that touch big parts of the Code Base and are like major, major changes to the app. That's just not how things work and it's uncomfortable.

Soroush Khanlou
I would even go a step further and I would say anybody who does expect that, especially in the first, like, let's say month, is an unreasonable manager and unreasonable coworker, frankly.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, totally. So that's something else that we talked about is team dynamics and expectations from the rest of the team and what to talk about with your manager. That was one of my piece of advice, was like, if you feel like feeling this stuff, worrying about how much you're contributing, worrying about imposter syndrome, right. Is everyone else on this team so much smarter than me? That is something you can talk to your manager about and hopefully they can do something helpful, reassure you, like, no, this is like, you're doing great as a new contributor to the team. I mean, there are a lot of bad software teams out there and just bad managers and they're places that you probably don't want to work for for a long time, honestly.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah.

Chris Dzombak
So, sort of in the same vein, another thing that we talked about is it's a small team. I think that this person said they're on the team with eight people. This entire startup that we're working on is nine people, including CEO and everyone. Right. So it's a small team. And another topic that came up was a sort of rock star programmer on the team, which I'm sure is something that you're familiar with, right?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah.

Chris Dzombak
In this case, it's someone on the team who's apparently frequently pushing 2000 line diffs that refactor, or I mean, probably not refactor in the strict sense of the word. Right. That rewrite just a huge part of the application for no apparent reason. It doesn't correspond to a user story in the agile sense or like a bug fix or some deliverable. It just because, well, I think this code is better. And it's something that this listener I talked to was finding. Some of these rewrites and some of the techniques that this developer is using hard to understand. I think that it's not just the listener, it's like other people on the team too. What are your thoughts on that dynamic?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, so one of the things that I kind of think about a lot is like, code review is not just a time for people who are more experienced to tell people who are less experienced how things work. It's also a chance for people who are less experienced to say, hey, I know I'm new here, but this doesn't actually make any sense to me. So either you're using some feature of the language of a code base that I don't understand or you're writing code in a maybe purposefully obtuse way. This isn't working. Can you explain this part? The person who is submitting the pull request is basically responsible for defending kind of like a thesis defense, like defending that code that they are presenting to the team. And part of that is making sure that everybody on the team is on board with the way that this new code looks and works and stuff. Yeah.

Chris Dzombak
An important part of code review is not just correcting code that people have written but making sure that people on the team are on board with what's happening or where with what's happening that they understand the changes that are being made. And it's a really good opportunity for some sort of impromptu education or like impromptu learning, impromptu mentoring. And that can be really helpful. And on the other hand, if it just consists of here's this huge 2000 line diff that makes things better and I don't care that half the team doesn't understand it. Yolo. That's really, really not a healthy team dynamic. That person is not being especially if the person who's contributing this is not open to helping people explain or helping people understand and doing that in a way that is helpful and not condescending. Right. The feigned what's the word?

Soroush Khanlou
The feigned surprise.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. What? You don't know how this works? Oh, my God. How are you a program.

Soroush Khanlou
You'Ve never heard of? Richard Stalman. I can't believe that.

Chris Dzombak
That's just such a I think unfortunately more common than it should be in the sort of programming world. But that's just super, just toxic and not helpful.

Soroush Khanlou
The idea there is you're saying that just making sure for everybody I've heard of this thing, I know what this is, just so everybody knows and kind of throwing the other person under the bus. Not kind of admitting the fact that there was a time when you didn't know that thing either. And there's other people might be listening along that also don't know and now they feel uncomfortable talking about it.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, the person isn't trying to accomplish anything good through that dynamic, I think maybe helping cover up their way of trying to deal with their own impostor syndrome which we should talk about, which is totally a thing that everybody, I think, feels and deals with. Am I right, Sirosh?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, absolutely. I think I gave a conference talk about it. I'm pretty into the imposter syndrome thing.

Chris Dzombak
Wait, you gave a conference talk about it?

Soroush Khanlou
I did.

Chris Dzombak
How did I not know this?

Soroush Khanlou
I don't know. Maybe you don't watch all my talks. It was called fear, uncertainty and doubt. I gave it at Coco Love in 2000 and something oh, man. I'll put it in the show notes. Yeah, basically, I talked about I used to work in academia, much like yourself, and I was in this lab, and I was in a bioengineering lab, and I was, like, stretching cow tissue, and I would be doing my work, and I would be paralyzed with fear pretty much every single day. Maybe there was a couple of days I didn't feel, but most days where that my boss would come in and just be like, you know what, Serge? Pack it up. Get out of here. I don't know what I was thinking. I don't know why I thought you could do this job, but you clearly can't. You're not doing enough work. You're not getting good data and all that stuff.

Chris Dzombak
You're just not smart enough to do this. Sorry, sir.

Soroush Khanlou
And that he would just literally just fire me on the spot and tell me to pack my things. Grad school doesn't work like that. That never happens to anybody. Not that I knew this at the time, but maybe that could happen in a real job, but it absolutely couldn't have happened in academia.

Chris Dzombak
I don't think it's going to happen, at least without a lot of warning, in a real job either.

Soroush Khanlou
I'm not saying it will happen in a real job. I'm just saying the fact that I was afraid of it in academia shows that it's like, a very irrational fear, and I think it's an irrational fear in a real job as well. So my first real full time job, we had a glass conference room in the corner of the office, and I could see when all the upper management was meeting, and I'd literally be writing code, and I'd be peering over my Imac, being like, they're talking about me in there. I absolutely know they're talking about me in there.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, we should put this in the show notes. And I will watch this. Somehow I had no idea that you've given this talk.

Soroush Khanlou
I think it's a decent talk. It's only ten minutes. It's pretty short. And then part of the resolution was like, I found a Medium post, I think. No, it was a regular blog post that's now hosted on Medium sorry. That linked to this thing on Wikipedia. And I read it, I was like, oh, my God, this is exactly what I'm feeling. And unfortunately, knowing about it makes it go away to some degree, but it also levels you up to dealing with more complex versions of imposter syndrome. But just reading the Wikipedia article did help me and understand, like, hey, other people feel this too. This is not a rational fear. This is fake to some degree.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. And it's not like, irrational fear, and it's fake. And it's also something that is totally a real feeling that pretty much everyone deals with. Right. I've mentioned at this job and at past jobs, I was like, how do I get these working? These other people, they're so smart. I'm like, these people are going to figure out that I have no idea what I'm doing.

Soroush Khanlou
Why did they even hire Chris?

Chris Dzombak
You get to a point where for some reason, you talk with someone about this stuff, right? And I know there's someone I follow on Twitter who is just super smart and really sharp, and I understand like, a third of the programming tweets that he posts at all. And one of the other things that he'll talk about, aside from crazy programming stuff that I don't understand, is his impostor syndrome all across the stack. It's imposter syndrome all the way down, right? Yeah. Which is just to say that this is totally understandable for you. The new programmer or any program or programmer, new job. Totally understandable. Totally a thing that you're going to feel and totally a thing that also everyone else is feeling and dealing with and maybe dealing with in a, like talking with their manager way. Maybe dealing with in a less healthy way, like not talking about it or rewriting half the app every week to prove to themselves and to the team that they can do this. Right?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. And that kind of thing. Also, if you're perhaps a less experienced engineer, that can seem intimidating, but if you're maybe even more experienced than this person who's pushing these huge diffs, you could be like, oh, actually, you're not building anything new, and we have new things to build. So you're maybe focused on the wrong things. And that's something that you might not see as a more junior person that you will see as a more senior person.

Chris Dzombak
It's something that you definitely won't see if you're like. The GitHub has the contributor stats on a repo, which it's super tempting to go look at and be like, okay, how much code am I pushing up compared to everyone else?

Soroush Khanlou
But I didn't know you could do that. I'm really thankful that I didn't know.

Chris Dzombak
You could do that. I'm sorry to have told you this then, but you can. But it's also like, I really hate that GitHub has this feature because it's not useful. What is it useful for? Aside from making the top two people feel good about themselves for a reason that really isn't valid? What you're contributing just does not correlate to number of lines you have touched in a code base.

Soroush Khanlou
Generally, there have been times when I've worked on really hard bugs that the fixport ends up being 1510 lines of code. But it took two weeks to figure those ten lines out.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. Figuring out what the ten lines are. The only thing that this feature accomplishes is like, helping people feel bad about themselves, which just isn't good.

Soroush Khanlou
I mean, there's also like, okay, we have this open source repo, and we want to send t shirts to everybody like the top, like the people who actually work on this project. And you can look at it and say, oh, these ten people are the people who actually do work on this project.

Chris Dzombak
Okay, I mean, I'll allow that. I'm giving you a little bit of a hot take here, but I feel you looking at this on your private repo with like eight people on it for your company is like I totally get the impulse if they're all full.

Soroush Khanlou
Time and they all have the same.

Chris Dzombak
Job, yeah, I totally get the impulse. But the only thing you're going to accomplish is, like, making yourself feel feel worse and so resist that temptation.

Soroush Khanlou
So you're mentioning this thing about having a rock star who is the only one who knows how to run the app. And things have to be done in their way, otherwise they can't really be done at all. There's this really funny story. It's called the inner JSON effect. I'll put it in show notes, and it's basically this story at this point, for me, it's like an Internet classic. This guy Jake, I'm sure names have been changed to protect the Internet, but this guy starts a new job. And so basically he starts working on this new job. He starts to check out from the source control, and it takes a really long time, takes a couple of days. And then he starts looking at these functions and these files that are in the thing. Everything is like a JSON object. And the JSON object has a key called class, and that tells you the name of the class. And then it has a key called function, and that's an array of numbers. So he starts digging in a little bit more and he realizes that each of these numbers kind of refers to a function somewhere else. So he starts to figure out what do these numbers mean? The numbers refer to I think they refer to the subversion checkout or the reversion commit number or something that that function was added in. And so he's like, playing with the code. He's, like, starting to work with it. And so he adds a little bit of code, comments it out, and then just like, he's kind of playing around. So he checks in the stuff that he's been working on because I don't think Survivor has, like, branches, right? So you can't just keep your stuff on a separate branch. So he kind of just checks it in, but it's commented on, so he's not worried about it. He goes away for the weekend. He comes back, and then everybody's really mad and everybody's freaking out and whole app is broken, the site's broken. And then I didn't mention, I don't think. But basically this whole system is the brainchild of one person named Tom.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, they all think tom.

Soroush Khanlou
So they basically pulled the new guy into the office and you broke this system. And he said, Why? And what'd you do? And he says, Well, I didn't really do anything. I just kind of put some new stuff in. And then I commented it out and checked it in, and the guy, Tom starts yelling. He's like, you can't use comments in Jdsl. That's what broke it. So apparently comments, like, wiped out the customer database because it doesn't actually parse the fact that they're comments, it just runs them like normal code. And so this rock star senior engineer boy is like, I knew it, you broke it. I can't deal with coders who can't understand the system. You either fire quit, or you either fire Jake or I quit, and he leaves the room. And then, of course, what choice do they have? Their entire system is built on what this guy knows, and they have no other choice, so they fire Jake. And Jake probably dodged a bullet on this one. But this is, I think, the worst situation you can be in. Right? This is the extreme of what we're talking about when we talk about the one engineer who thinks they run the show and controls the whole code base and submits these huge pull requests to change stuff.

Chris Dzombak
Totally. And so I think the lesson here, this is clearly a really extreme example, but that's funny. It's also really funny, but it's the sort of dynamic where you have that sort of rockstar genus programmer, and everyone else in fear to them sometimes doesn't really understand how large parts of the system work is not only bad for everyone on the team, but it's bad for the company, too. Like having one person who's like, that much of a single point of a single point of failure.

Soroush Khanlou
The bus factor.

Chris Dzombak
Right. I forget if that's a high or a low bus factor, but it's either way.

Soroush Khanlou
Bus factor.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, low bus factor. That's bad.

Soroush Khanlou
How many people have to get hit by a bus for your company to stop working or for your team to stop working? And the answer here is one person. If one person goes away, then everything's worked.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. And, well, we could solve that just by banning all buses.

Soroush Khanlou
Not a bad solution.

Chris Dzombak
Stupid joke. Anyway, that is just to say that this sort of thing is, again, I think is unfortunately common in a lot of software teams to some extent, not to the extent that this example illustrates. I think it's important to recognize that and to recognize that that is what's going on, or that that dynamic is at play on your team when it's happening. Because if you don't, then, like, you start, like, driving yourself crazy, like, thinking about, like, man, this guy's just like, a genius. How do I possibly compare or contribute to the same code base?

Soroush Khanlou
Well, the tricky part is when you're just starting out, it's so hard to know this stuff. Like, how could you know that this is a that we deal with in our industry?

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, well, by listening to podcasts where people talk about it.

Soroush Khanlou
That's right.

Chris Dzombak
Where's my bell? My bell is lost. That's why we're talking about it, right? Because it's not obvious when you start a new job, that all, quote, unquote good programmers are not pushing up a giant pull request that rewrites a major part of the app every few weeks.

Soroush Khanlou
Right.

Chris Dzombak
That's not what's supposed to happen. Yeah, that's not supposed to happen unless people are expecting that. And you've agreed that you're going to do this in order to deliver some feature or to reduce some sort of technical debt or to fix some sort of bug or, like, do something user facing. Right? Yeah. That's not something that is generally helpful or healthy or useful. Right. And I think it's unfortunately common, but it's not something that should drive you to feel bad about yourself.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, I think that's basically right. One other thing I want to throw in, as long as we're kind of talking about this, this was kind of bubbling around on Twitter this morning. It's kind of funny because it's a tweet by an account called Code Wisdom, but it's an actual tweet by someone who's on Twitter and has their own ability to say whatever they want to say. So it's kind of like that office joke about you miss 100% of the shots you don't take that's right. By Wayne Gretzky, by Michael Scott or whatever. But the quote is, it's from Patrick Mackenzie. And he writes that website, Kalzumius, which has all that good salary negotiation info. And the quote is, every great developer, you know, got there by solving problems they were unqualified to solve until they actually did it. And I think that that is a really good explanation of what's happening with a lot of people. And one of the ways I found it was that Mike Ash tweeted. He quote tweeted, he says, People sometimes ask how I learn the crazy stuff I like to do. This is how if it works for Mike Ash, with all the things that Mike Ash knows, probably it's a pretty good strategy. If you can teach Mike Ash, it could probably teach you.

Chris Dzombak
Totally.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah.

Chris Dzombak
Mike Ash is so smart. I'm not as smart as Mike Ash and he can do all this crazy stuff.

Soroush Khanlou
I don't like hearing that kind of talk, Chris.

Chris Dzombak
I know, but that's where we are, right? I'm a human sarosh.

Soroush Khanlou
That's right.

Chris Dzombak
I think that's all I have on that subject, really, just to kind of wrap that up. Congratulations on your new job or your new career. There's quick bullet points. It's totally normal to take months and months, especially if you're dealing with a new stack or like unfamiliar technology, to feel comfortable, to feel like you're making a contribution to a team. There are often weird and unhealthy dynamics and power structures in programming teams. It's hard, but I think important to recognize that when that's going on, because it can otherwise make you feel really bad about yourself. It's okay to talk with your manager about stuff like this. If you can't talk with your manager about stuff like this or your manager is dismissive, that's a bad thing. And you may want to think about finding somewhere with a different manager as your personal situation allows. Impostor syndrome is totally a real thing and something that everybody deals with. You're doing fine, everything is going to be okay.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, I would just add like you can't and you shouldn't expect to be really good at something the week that you start that isn't a real thing. And it's normal to take time to learn something and to get good at something, especially with something as a weird as programming where it's like none of the metaphors that you think should apply do apply. Like the idea of building a house is not the same as building a piece of software. It just doesn't work like that. And it being so weird means you're going to need time to wrap your head around all of the little weird things. That all the different weird ways that software is different than other things that have more basis in the physical world. And so give yourself that time. If other people don't want to give you that time, then find ways to either get out of that job or to get them off your back or whatever while you learn or while you figure stuff out. Yeah, that's kind of all I got.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. So hopefully this is useful podcast. I want to move on to talking about adding a Toggle method to the pool type in Swift.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, let's do it.

Chris Dzombak
So there's a proposal open se one nine nine to add a Toggle method to bool in Swift, which is a mutating function that does exactly what you think it does. If the bool is true and you call my Boolean variable toggle, then it'll be false. And if you do that again it'll mutate it back to true. So this is mutating in place. The motivation that is given is like if you have reading this out aloud isn't going to be great, but my variable prop one, prop two enabled then toggling that is really kind of verbose because you have to write that whole thing equals not myVar prop one, prop two enabled. And so it's really verbose. And I saw this and had surprisingly strong feelings about this. What are your thoughts on this?

Soroush Khanlou
Well, you're the one with the strong feelings. I would like to hear them.

Chris Dzombak
Really? I'm worried I'm going to contaminate your.

Soroush Khanlou
No, I know what I think.

Chris Dzombak
Okay. I think that this is bad and we shouldn't add it basically to well, for several different reasons. First of all, the motivation that's given here is a bad motivation in my view. If you're ever reaching across so many layers of what's the right word here? Layers of indirection. If you're ever reaching this far into an object or into the objects that an object has some reference to in. Order to mutate a variable like that state. This points to a poor API design where instead the intermediate classes here, intermediate data types, whatever they are, should expose a nicer API for doing whatever you're trying to do. You should never have three periods into some object and then be like, mutating a little bit of state in there. You should ideally be able to just tell whatever you have a reference to, hey, change behavior in this way, or do this thing and it can coordinate whatever is necessary.

Soroush Khanlou
And you could do it in a domain safe way as well. So you can say, like, right, make it make the user an admin instead of MyObject myuser admin and abilities on equals toggle or whatever.

Chris Dzombak
Right, exactly.

Soroush Khanlou
So you worry this violates liskoff liskoff.

Chris Dzombak
Or law of demeter, right?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, it's love demeter, not liskoff.

Chris Dzombak
So this is very like a law of demeter based argument. And I totally get that there are some poorly designed APIs where you might have to do this, but I think that the solution here is not to make it easier to do that. I think that if you're dealing with one of these APIs, putting some sort of, like, facade pattern solution in place is probably the right thing to do.

Soroush Khanlou
Right.

Chris Dzombak
I think the motivation for this change is just encouraging a poor and potentially dangerous API design. Aside from that, it's just weird to have a mutating method that does something. So I don't know that does something so simple. I mean, it is small, but it's not a small conceptual API change. In my view, we're adding a top level mutating function to bull to do this one tiny little thing. And I don't really like that. I know you have the like, you deserve nice things talk. Where do deserve nice things? Where you argue that adding convenience things like this to APIs is nice and is a good idea.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. Let me get you with what I think is the counterpoint.

Chris Dzombak
What is the counterpoint?

Soroush Khanlou
Okay, so my feeling on this is, first of all, anything that increases expressiveness is basically really good. And I'm for it. Pretty much anything you can think to add, I would be down for essentially. So that's like number one.

Chris Dzombak
How about dynamic member lookup?

Soroush Khanlou
Okay, all right, you got me. I think that was a patreon episode. So people don't get that joke, but it's fine. So, yeah. So things to add expressiveness, I'm very down for the other side of it. The direct kind of point to the logometer thing is you're thinking of this in terms of, like, okay, I have an app. It's a long living thing. It's got probably a big team working on it. It really matters what the API is. I have the time and the need to get it right. Whereas sometimes some of the stuff you do with Swift is going to just be writing simple scripts to munge data. And so when you're doing that, you don't really care about adding all your cute little extensions back to make sure that, okay, well, this object, because I don't want to dig too deep into it. Need this facade for this thing. You're not going to do that. You just want to flip the bull. You don't care about any of the niceties of the API. You're just trying to get some code that works to process some data. Because what you care about is the data at the end of the day, you don't care about the code. The code you might even throw away. And so my feeling there is that this prevents bugs there because instead of this one's, prop one, prop two enabled, you might do prop one, prop two hidden. And so you have a little bug there where both sides of the equal side are not flipping the same thing. So it can fix a bug. And it's just designed to have you write less code at the point of use, essentially. So you're typing code right when you need that Toggling ability. You're not going to say, oh, I actually do have a flaw in my design here. I'm going to go back and fix it. You just want to write the code that works. And so I think especially for use cases of Swift that you and I are not typically used to, this kind of thing could be super nice and you don't have to use it. Don't use it.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, I totally get that argument. If you're just doing something that quickly munges like data, I'm still slightly unclear on. So you want to quickly deal with all this data, but it's in nested structs or like nested classes. I don't know offhand how useful this would be in a dictionary situation. Right. If you just have like a JSON dictionary or something you're dealing with, it.

Soroush Khanlou
Would be useful because you can do like my dictionary and then do a subscript and then do Toggle as long as the dictionary is mutable. Okay, you don't know that the thing is a bool. I guess if it's like a string to bool dictionary, it would work perfectly.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, you could question mark toggle. I'm not sure how convincing offhand I find the quick script that munges data sort of use case. Also, if you're doing that, I don't think Swift is really great language for quick and dirty one off sort of disposable things like that.

Soroush Khanlou
I did one a couple of weeks ago. I didn't hate it.

Chris Dzombak
Okay. All right. My counterargument is just that what you described is not what's written in the motivation section of this proposal. What's written in the motivation section of the proposal is something that like, if you wrote this in code review, regardless of whether or not there's a toggle method, I would flag this in code review as something be like, let's chat about API design. Love to meter. Let's figure out what you're trying to accomplish and see if we can put a nicer API around it.

Soroush Khanlou
The motivation mentions Nested Structs specifically, and I think that that could be a nice way to think about it. Just because Structs you can add convenience methods and convenience getters and setters to them, but you typically don't. You typically are accessing the whole data structure all at once. And so since it's not kind of class based, like, encapsulation isn't as serious of a thing.

Chris Dzombak
I'm not sure if I buy that. You don't usually add methods or convenience things to Struct.

Soroush Khanlou
Especially the one who wrote this. And I think he has a style where he does that. Yeah, but either way, I'm fine agreeing to disagree on this one. I think the Swift Standard Library, while it's better than foundation, still errors on the side of not enough helpers and useful things, and I end up, like, even that little script I wrote, I ended up adding, like, six extensions because I wanted to write a little bit nicer code.

Chris Dzombak
Really?

Soroush Khanlou
And it's like, yeah, I needed count where and I needed a bunch of other stuff, and it was like, seriously.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. We'll make sure to throw a link to your you deserve nice things talk in the show notes and agree to disagree. Although I think I'm now less opposed to this proposal than I was initially.

Soroush Khanlou
We've come together a little bit.

Chris Dzombak
Just a little bit. I still don't like it that much.

Soroush Khanlou
I still don't like it.

Chris Dzombak
Get off my lawn.

Soroush Khanlou
That's right. Yeah. Cool.

Chris Dzombak
That's what I've got. Thank you so much for listening. I hope this episode was at least a little bit helpful. You're doing great, I'm sure.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, you're all doing great. You're all beautiful.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, you're all wonderful.

Soroush Khanlou
You're all made of stars. Okay, I'll talk to you next week.

Chris Dzombak
What?

Soroush Khanlou
Bye. I said that just didn't work. Podcasting is hard. Yes.
