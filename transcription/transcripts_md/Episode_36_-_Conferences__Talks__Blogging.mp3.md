Chris Dzombak
Hi, everyone. Welcome to Fatal Error. I'm Chris.

Soroush Khanlou
And I'm, sirous.

Chris Dzombak
And this week we thought we'd talk about conferences and maybe particularly speaking at conferences, although I suspect we'll branch out.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, conferences are definitely like I feel like they're a really big part of our community, and a lot of people have the goal of speaking at a conference. And so as someone who am speaking at, I think, seven conferences this year, I would kind of want to put that out there and see if anybody has questions or if Chrissy have things you want to talk about.

Chris Dzombak
Seven conferences this year.

Soroush Khanlou
Seven conferences? Yeah, I mean, three of them are over and there's four coming up.

Chris Dzombak
That's really impressive, especially considering we're about halfway through the year. And for my part, I mean, I want to ask you some questions and hear about some of your experiences and also maybe try to discuss conferences in the community from more attendee perspective.

Soroush Khanlou
For sure. There's a lot of like, I know you go to Strange Loop, and that's not necessarily an iOS conference, but I think some of the stuff they talk about there is super interesting. So I want to pick your brain about that too.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, I've been to one strange Loop so far.

Soroush Khanlou
Still more than me.

Chris Dzombak
Fair enough. Well, let's kick it off. So the next conference that you're speaking at is 360 IDEV, which is in just a few weeks now, right?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, it's in Denver, and it's in, I think, three or so weeks.

Chris Dzombak
Cool. And how big a conference is this? I've never gone. I know a little bit about it, but only a little.

Soroush Khanlou
So it's pretty big. It's like 400 people, which is a reasonably sized conference, I would say, for our community.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, I'd say so.

Soroush Khanlou
I'm giving the keynote, which is a little bit nerve wracking, so I'm writing a brand new talk for that should be pretty intense.

Chris Dzombak
So I was going to ask I know that you've given your sequence talk a few times now, so you're doing something totally new.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, I figured for the keynote, there may not necessarily be technical people in the audience. The sequence and collection thing is kind of tailor suited for the weeds. It's very in the weeds, which is like, I like the weeds, and I think the show we spend a lot of time in the weeds and we enjoy it. But I think for kind of a broader audience, it may not be the exact right sort of topic. So I wanted to write something that was a little bit more general, a little bit more friendly and welcoming, basically.

Chris Dzombak
Can you share what you will be talking about yet, or is this a surprise?

Soroush Khanlou
No, I'm happy to share. The first draft is written, which I find is like the most the heaviest part of the work. So I have a pretty good concept of what it's about, but it may shift slightly and there's a patreon only episode. So this is like a secret for our patreon listeners. If you're going to be at 360 IDEV, let me know and do the thing where you wink and then you flick your nose with your index finger so that I know that you're a listener of the show, or just come.

Chris Dzombak
Up and say, hey Sirush, I listen to the show.

Soroush Khanlou
That would be fine too. So the topic of the talk, it originally was called Everything I Have That's Good, I Got from Writing, but it sort of morphed into this very similar, but I think more refined and more useful topic called Finding Your Place on the Internet. And it's all about back in the day, I would read like, John Gruber's blog and I'd be like, oh man, John Gruber is so cool and I want to blog just like him. But you don't really know what you're getting yourself into when you say something like that. And even worse, if you just clone what John Gruber does. People don't want a diet version of John Gruber, they'll just go to the real thing. So you really have to figure out your own sort of approach to whatever it is that you want to make and put on the Internet. And that involves finding your voice. It involves a lot of things of figuring out who you are and who your audience is and what you want to be to that audience. And so that's the broad topic. It's basically how I write, why I write. And if you want to build something, whether it's an app or you want to build like, an audience on YouTube, or you want to get your ideas out in the world, whatever it is, or what I've learned in going through that process, basically, this seems like something.

Chris Dzombak
That I would be really interested in listening to. And I'm not going to be at this conference, but I hope it's recorded or you can give me a crash course at some point.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, totally. Maybe I can do a practice version of it for you.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, I would love that.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, they should be doing videos, so ideally the video will be up at some point, but okay, cool.

Chris Dzombak
So that's something that I wanted to I've asked you about this before, but I want to ask you again and again. You blog weekly, or at least almost weekly, right?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, I mean, when I'm on and blogging weekly. Okay, but then the last two weeks, I haven't blogged between after dubdub, I did weekly, but before dubdub it was like I think I did five posts all year, so maybe that's once a month, something like that. So it's sometimes weekly when I have the time and when I have the ability. It's weekly, but not always.

Chris Dzombak
And then you've given many more talks than I have. And I haven't given really any conference talks. I've given talks at local meetups and things like that before.

Soroush Khanlou
But how do you well, and internal talks at companies that you work at, right? Like you gave that spring talk and a reactive one.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, absolutely. Well, most of the slides for the reactive talk were stolen from my friend Andrew, who is a really sharp developer and to whom I did give credit in that talk. I wanted to ask, how do you come up with ideas for blog posts to write weekly or almost weekly? If someone asks you to write a talk, how do you come up with an idea for that talk? I feel like if you gave me a topic and you're like, hey, Chris, can you talk about memory management? Can you talk about some topic? I could absolutely write a talk about it. But if you're just like, aiming to write a talk or aiming to write a blog post, how do you find something that's interesting to write about or to talk about?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, first of all, I want to note that we're already in the meta level of it's, a conference talk about conference talks at this point, which was a podcast about conference talks about conference talks, which I'm down for, but I just want to call that out. So blogs and blog posts and conference talks are very different blogs. If people don't like them, they don't have to read them. They can just see the link, say, wow, this is insanely boring, I don't care, and just skip right past in their feed reader or in Twitter or whatever, a conference talk. Someone is in that seat, and you are one of maybe six, maybe eight, maybe 15, maybe 40 talks that they could see over the course of this 2345 days. And so you have their attention for this thing. And that attention I feel like you have to treat as much more precious than a blog post, because ultimately someone will read the first sentence of the first three paragraphs of your blog post, decide it's boring, and just close the tab, then it's fine. But when you have someone and also if they decide to read it all, the whole blog post takes five or ten minutes to read, unless it's super, super long, but it doesn't take too long to read, whereas a conference talk is 40 minutes, like 20 to 40 minutes, and you have this person's attention. Actually, this like 150 to 1000 people's attention for that time. And so I think you have to be more circumspect when you're thinking about a conference topic than you do with a blog post, because the blog is really more about you and what you want to write about. And the conference talk is more of, oh, also, people are paying to see conference talks. One other thing. So they paid 600, $800 for a ticket to this conference, and you're like some percentage of that. And so you really need to respect their time.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, no pressure.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, exactly. And I'm like setting the whole the tone for the whole thing. So I have to kind of figure out like I don't know. The keynote is very stressful. It's my first keynote.

Chris Dzombak
I have confidence that you'll do well, and I'm happy to thank you.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, I hope so.

Chris Dzombak
I'm happy to let you practice on me.

Soroush Khanlou
You can get a sense for this talk too.

Chris Dzombak
I guess I maybe hadn't thought so much about the differences between these two, but either way, how do you start coming up with ideas of topics for either of these things?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, more on the concrete level. The stuff that I try to do is stuff I think I would like to see six months ago, basically. So if it's a conference talk, it's like, well, I'm at this conference, I've already paid a ton of money. What do I want to learn a ton about that I maybe wouldn't have had a chance to learn about in another context? And so that's why I picked the sequence and collection thing because it's like something that I would like everybody to know about. I think everybody should know about it. It's not something that you're going to find a really comprehensive resource about and it's something that you can kind of get on stage and teach in a way that is harder for other topics. Let's say the coordinators talk that I gave that was more along the lines of more academic environment. You might present some research that you've done and that was kind of more like what that was intended to be. And then there's always the like, let me talk about my story, let me talk about my experiences and impart some sort of knowledge onto the crowd. The softer type of talk. And that's kind of like the Kanye West talk I gave. Kind of like this talk that I'm going to probably be giving at 360 IDEV. And so the talks are basically through that lens of, well, this person's stuck there and you have to respect their 40 minutes. Those are the kinds of things that usually come out of it for me. The blog posts, on the other hand, are like anything that tickles me, basically. I'm just like, something interesting is happening here and I don't know what it is and I hammer on it until I have a concrete thing to post about and then I post. So, for example, I did one blog post a while ago about the idea of using View controllers for behaviors. So if you take a View controller and you add it as a child View controller, that View controller automatically gets like View did appear if you did disappear callbacks. So if you wanted to hook some behavior into those callback hooks, you can do that pretty easily. You might make an analytics View controller that every time View did appear is called. It sends some analytics request and then that is then attached to some behavior by adding as a child, which kind of also adds it as a behavior. And so I was like, oh, there's something really interesting here. And then you also don't have to store it because the child view controllers array stores it for you so you don't have to add a property for it or do any kind of associated objects kind of thing. Yeah, so that was something I was like, there's something really interesting here. I don't really know what it is yet, but I'm going to dig into it until I figure out what it is and what it's useful for. And then once that kind of research exploration stage is done, then I try to basically hook the reader with like, here's the problem that many of us have, and then I try to say, here's one approach for solving it, basically. So the blog posts are really more about like, if I was tickled by this problem, what would I want to read about it? That would kind of enlighten me and so that's what I should sort of shoot for.

Chris Dzombak
Okay, yeah, I guess maybe that just requires being a little bit more introspective isn't exactly the right word, but maybe a little bit more self aware about sort of what sort of things I'm working on than I am right now.

Soroush Khanlou
Right, yeah, I think self awareness is part of it. I think kind of like empathy is part of it too, of being able to put yourself in someone else's shoes and say, what might this other person find interesting about this?

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, I'm hoping as of two months ago, my new role, I'm going to be working with or I am working with everyone from PhD students and postdocs to undergrad research assistants. And I'm discovering more and more that, oh, there's a lot of software engineering, sort of just principles. There are a lot of things that I can teach everyone here that I wish someone had taught me when I was in undergrad. And I'm hoping that or I think that that really will lead to some interesting blog posts, that if you don't have years of software development experience, that may be really useful blog posts, even if they seem somewhat obvious to people who've been doing this for a decade, for sure.

Soroush Khanlou
I'm excited to read the because you've already published one of these posts, right?

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, this may still be my most recent blog post. I haven't posted anything in a while, but I posted something on my blog a little while ago about what don't repeat yourself actually means. Right. This is something that comes up in code review really often and you can sort of throw the acronym dry, like don't repeat yourself around colloquially. And that's something that actually isn't totally clear to someone who's new to software development or who's new to software engineering and solid principles. And so I put together this post, I kind of have a reference to point to so that if we're reviewing code for someone, we actually have something to point to that says, hey, this seems kind of repetitive and this is why it's bad. And these are the sort of things that we want you to think about or that anyone wants you to think about when you're writing code. I would say over the medium to longer term here, look for some other posts sort of in this vein from me at least, right?

Soroush Khanlou
And what I was going to say is I'm really excited about this, if you can call it a series, like I hope it turns into a series of basically because you're doing the same thing here, right? You're saying when I was first starting out, what would I have liked to know about? Basically, don't repeat yourself and you have an audience in mind and you have this topic and it's like a well researched and long and well written article and it's something that doesn't exist. Like, I remember when we were talking about it, you were like, yeah, I went hunting for something like this and I just couldn't find it.

Chris Dzombak
I was like, we were discussing this and I went looking for a decent reference or decent introduction to this and didn't find one. And I asked you and you didn't have anything to point me to either. And I assume that I know actually that I will keep coming with these things like, oh, there's actually really no good really there's, there's no really good reference, there's no really good introduction to this that I can find. And it's really hard to think back to when I was first learning this stuff and remember, oh, yeah, this was kind of difficult. But I'm in a position right now where there are people who are at least somewhat new to a lot of these concepts. And so, hopefully that can really jog my memory and prompt me to write some useful things.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, for sure. I'm looking forward to these posts. I think they're going to be good.

Chris Dzombak
So if we go back to conferences, maybe at least for a few minutes, as someone who wants to attend conferences, there are a lot of iOS conferences, there are a lot of general software engineering conferences. How do you decide what conferences to attend and what conferences to maybe sit back on?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, I think when I was younger, it was a lot about the people who were speaking okay. And so it was like, oh, well, this person is going to be here. It'll be really interesting to get their perspective on a certain thing. And I think as I kind of went to a couple of these, I realized that for me at least, the talks are not the most important thing. It's really the people who are there and conversations that you can have in the hallway, as they say. Okay, so the stuff that I look for is like, if there's a conference my friends are attending, or if there's a conference someone that I know that seems interesting or smart is attending, I'll shoot for that. And then the other big thing is this is also dependent on price and dependent on access and stuff like that. But if you can go somewhere, like really foreign and really interesting, that's also like, basically a slam dunk. So if there's a cool conference in Europe and you want to go to this particular city, that would be great conference there's. Tri Swift, Japan if you always wanted to go to Tokyo but never had a good excuse, you may actually go to the conference first. You may make some friends, and they all hang out in Tokyo and Japan broadly for a couple of days after, and you can kind of maybe tag along with them and explore the country in way that you really wouldn't be able to explore otherwise. Yeah, so, yes, I would say, like, base it on the people who are going to be there in terms of the speakers, the people who are going to be there in terms of the audience and then the place that it's at.

Chris Dzombak
That makes sense. Yeah, a lot of things are about people and location that makes a lot of sense. You mentioned access to some of these conferences, and I just wanted to briefly call out that for a lot of conferences there will be some number of scholarships available or some amount of assistance. This is true, I know of WWDC and of a lot of other conferences in this community. And so even if you feel like something may not be immediately within your reach, there's at least a chance with some conferences that there's some amount of help available to let you go if.

Soroush Khanlou
You'Re a student or something like that. One interesting way to think about this is like, the marginal cost. Like the cost to the conference organizer to add one more person is usually pretty small. They've already got the venue, they're paying a flat rate for that. The food is really fudged, so they're probably going to have a ton of leftovers anyway. So the cost to adding someone who wouldn't be going anyway is pretty minimal. So they're actually sometimes pretty happy to do it. So if you just reach out and say, hey, I'm a student, I can't really afford this, but your conference seems really cool and also bonus, maybe you've built something that's really cool that the conference organizer likes and they want you to be there at their conference. You may be surprised by how often people will move some stuff to make it so that you can come.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, I remember when I was a student, and not necessarily with conferences, but just in general, I don't think I fully appreciated just how much flexibility people in general have in whether it's planning some sort of event or conference or I don't know. I remember, even in university, I was just very nervous about trying to find time to talk with a professor at my university. Right. And looking back at this now and working at the same university now, I go back and sort of look at some of the things that still stick with me from undergrad and think, oh, you know, I really should have just tried to talk with that professor about that topic, and it probably would have been good.

Soroush Khanlou
People are really friendly. Yeah, people are much more friendly than you would expect.

Chris Dzombak
Right. Try to talk with whoever's organizing a conference or talk with whoever runs scholarships for the conference. That seems really interesting to you. So you mentioned thinking about the people who will be at a specific conference, and I just wanted to call out. This is something that I definitely think about if I'm considering going to a conference, but it's kind of a double edged sword. Like, many things are something that I've found, frankly, just kind of stressful when I've gone to WDC in the past, is that there are so many people there and so many people who I'd like to see and so many people that it's almost just it's a really stressful week. And I know that Beacon can kind of help with this, although I wasn't at WDC this year, so I didn't really get a chance to try Beacon. Right. That was something that almost discouraged me from going to Dub Dub. DC is just like just work and sort of mental effort and energy that goes into trying to see everybody who I can possibly see and pack my schedule with everyone who I know is going to be in San Jose for the week.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, for sure.

Chris Dzombak
That was one of a couple of reasons that I didn't end up going to WBC this year, was just like, I didn't need the stress of it. I also had a scheduling conflict.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, I mean, scheduling conflict aside, I would say that if you're not going to have fun at something, definitely don't do it. And especially Dub Dub. I take recharge days, recharge blocks. Like, if I just want to get lunch alone just because I'm so stressed out about hanging out with people, I will absolutely do that. And I will just go take a walk or I will listen to a podcast or just go hide in my hotel room. I've definitely done that in years past. But dubdub is, I think, unique in that everybody is there. Most of these other conferences, if you've been doing this stuff for a while, maybe like three or four of your friends are there, and that's it. Or like three or four of your close friends, and so you know you're going to see them and then maybe a few people that are acquaintances that if you see them, great, and if you don't, you don't. Dub Dub is something like six, maybe 7000 people and like something like 360 I'd have 400 people. Something like what's? A smaller one? I think like French Kit in Paris I think is like 150 people. With that amount of people it's much easier to kind of say hi to everybody. It's also a much smaller cross section of your friends. So you're not going to be stressed out about like, oh, I have 40 friends in town, there's no way I can see them all. And now I have to choose which ones I'm going to get to see and which ones I'm not. Yeah, so I think the conferences that aren't dubbed up, them being smaller makes it a lot easier.

Chris Dzombak
I guess that's a fair point. Yeah, that's definitely something to keep in mind.

Soroush Khanlou
Well, and they do range in size. So you've been to Strange Loop. Strange Loop is like 800, 900 people.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, I don't know an exact number, but that seems about right. And I know that they actually are expanding it this year so they have significantly more tickets. It's probably like over 1000 people at this point. Right. So I went to Strangeloop last year, which was my first year going. I'm going back again this year. It's in toward the end of September and I think there are still a few tickets available if any listeners are interested. But I really enjoyed it. Last year I was there with a few coworkers from the Times. This year I'm just going by myself, but I think I'll see a few coworkers from the Times there and I'm really looking forward to it. There are a bunch of interesting talks, not just iOS. In fact, there are very few iOS centric talks. Yeah, I'm really looking forward to this one for whatever reason, as you were saying, maybe because not everybody is there, it's less stressful and at least for me, it's less stressful. And I really enjoyed St. Louis last.

Soroush Khanlou
Year when I was there and strangely is multi track too. Right. So you kind of pick what you want to see for that hour or whatever.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah.

Soroush Khanlou
Where a lot of the smaller conferences in our community are single track. So it's like you're in this room or you're somewhere else. Like you're either seeing the talks or you're not.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, absolutely.

Soroush Khanlou
So you can kind of pick and choose. So it's a little bit bigger of a conference. The other interesting thing about Strange Loop is like the topics are all really weird, right?

Chris Dzombak
I wouldn't say weird necessarily. I wouldn't say they're all really weird. There are I think they try to strike a balance between some more what's the right word? Like esoteric or academic sort of topics that are very sort of out there. Computer sciencey and some more sort of down to earth things that you will encounter in your day to day software development life. But I think that makes it kind of interesting. Last year I went to a talk about how the Go languages, I think Data Race detector works. And that was both interesting and, like, fairly down to earth. Right. That's something that or maybe it was. I forget what kind of detector it was, but it used the same sort of thing under the hood as Thread Sanitizer does. That's built into Xcode. Right, right. And also went to a talk that has absolutely nothing to do with my day to day job, which was about at a really high level, it was about mathematical simulation, how mathematical works to simulate certain kinds of systems. And, I mean, that's not something I use day to day, but it was really interesting.

Soroush Khanlou
Nice. I've seen topics like, there's one that I really like called Spreadsheets for Developers, and it's a woman who writes, I think, insertion sort or selection sort using Excel. Like, not even using weird features of Excel. Just, like, straight up normal Excel and stuff like that. You don't find that at other conferences. And it's really cool.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, it is really cool. This isn't a strange loop talk, but we'll throw a link in the show notes. Two to this, I think, 15 minutes video where someone at a different conference implements a Turing machine in PowerPoint.

Soroush Khanlou
I saw that one. That was wild.

Chris Dzombak
Because why not?

Soroush Khanlou
Because you can't. Yeah. Strangers. Seems really cool. And is it a longer conference, do you find?

Chris Dzombak
No. You mean just in terms of, like, scheduling, number of length of time?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah.

Chris Dzombak
No, it's a I forget exactly. Thursday. Friday Saturday, I think. Or maybe just Friday Saturday. It's a like, two or three day conference. I guess I could check my calendar here. But no, it's not a dub dub DC length conference. It's like a long weekend, basically.

Soroush Khanlou
Got you. Yeah. And then did you know anybody that was going as well, or did you just make friends when you got there?

Chris Dzombak
Last year I knew a couple of my coworkers who were going and did make a couple of new friends when I was there, too. This year, I think a couple of my old coworkers from the Times will still be there, but I haven't really coordinated with anyone. I'm just planning to show up and assume it'll be pretty fun.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, I'm sure it'll be good.

Chris Dzombak
Worst case, St. Louis has jazz and beer, so I'll be pretty happy.

Soroush Khanlou
There you go. Yeah. I think it's all about kind of what you can get out of them. If the talks are what you like, great. If the kind of hallway conversations are what you like, great. If you feel like you have a little bit more social anxiety and you want to travel in a group, then you should do it that way. It's all about whatever you do that makes you happy and makes you feel comfortable while you're there. It's all about making sure that you have a good time.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, absolutely.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. And if you like, especially if it's in. A cool place, and there's jazz and beer, and you skip out for a couple of hours and you go do something fun. Nobody will lock you for that.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, I think you're still waiting in that case.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, exactly.

Chris Dzombak
So maybe going back to where we started this episode, I feel like there was another episode where we discussed some of the considerations that you had when you were giving a conference talk. Maybe this was the Tri Swift Japan episode.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, I think we did an episode on both Australia and Japan, and we talked about some of the conference stuff there too. Yeah.

Chris Dzombak
So if you're interested in hearing more about this topic, we'll include links to both of those episodes in the show notes. And aside from that, I don't know if I really have anything to add.

Soroush Khanlou
No, I don't think I have anything else to add either. If you're going to be at 360 IDEV, definitely say hi. If you see me at another conference later this year, also say hi. I love talking to podcast listeners.

Chris Dzombak
If you're going to be at Strange Loop this year, definitely say hi. You can find us on Twitter. I don't think we've actually put links to our Twitter accounts and show notes in a long time. Yeah, we don't do that much, but we'll do that. And if you want to hit us up at either of these conferences, then use Twitter to find us.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, for sure. Say hi. And maybe say use Beacon to oh, that's right. Yeah. Beacon is actually going to be an official partner of 360 IDV. There will be official stuff on there. My talk will be on there, and I'll be, you know, on the ground, going to bars and restaurants and posting up on the app. So if you see me there, you can also join a Beacon event. Cool.

Chris Dzombak
And I'll see if I can make beacon happen at Strange Loop.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, for sure.

Chris Dzombak
Cool. Well, on that note, I guess, Sergey, it's been great talking with you. Oh, thank you so much to all of you, our Patreon supporters. As we've said time and time again, you make it possible for us to pay for the show to be edited and for our hosting costs and other incidentals that come up. And we really do appreciate your support. Thank you very much.

Soroush Khanlou
For sure. Much love to the Patreon people.

Chris Dzombak
Absolutely. And on that note, I will talk to you next week.

Soroush Khanlou
Sounds great. Talk to you soon.
