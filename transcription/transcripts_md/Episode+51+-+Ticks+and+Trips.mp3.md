Chris Dzombak
Man. The temperature has actually gone down since I woke up this morning. How is that jesus.

Soroush Khanlou
That's not supposed to happen.

Chris Dzombak
No, that's not how it's supposed to work. Welcome to Fatal Air season four. Are we on season four?

Soroush Khanlou
Yes.

Chris Dzombak
Great.

Soroush Khanlou
Yes. This is season four. Welcome, season four.

Chris Dzombak
Thanks for listening.

Soroush Khanlou
We made it so far we did 50 episodes, Chris.

Chris Dzombak
That is a lot. I think that we we'll get six seasons in a movie.

Soroush Khanlou
I'd be down for six seasons. Like a Christmas special.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, we'll do that. We have another year before you have to worry about that. Today, when I first logged onto my computer, it was minus five degrees outside. Now apparently, it's minus ten.

Soroush Khanlou
That's way too cold. Now, are we talking with the wind chill or without the windshield? Let's see what we got going on here.

Chris Dzombak
I think that's with wind chill. Okay, that makes more sense.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, that sounds about right.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, there's a wind chill advisory thing today.

Soroush Khanlou
I'm getting zero degrees Fahrenheit in Ann Arbor, which is still very cold.

Chris Dzombak
It's still zero. Yeah. I don't know. My little weather thing. It's cold is the gist. Yeah, and check.

Soroush Khanlou
It's cold here, too, but not so bad. The high is 28, which is pretty cold, but the low is only practically.

Chris Dzombak
Swimming weatherly freezing for a Michigan. My brother has moved to Minneapolis, and that even cold there. Even colder. Yeah, it's not good. So let's see. What do we want to we haven't talked in a while. We have a little bit of catching up to do, and then we have a couple of topic ideas. I do want to hear about your notes based project management.

Soroush Khanlou
For sure.

Chris Dzombak
I want to ask you about baking bread, which is something that I know.

Soroush Khanlou
I can do hours on. Baking rest. Should we just start a new podcast right now?

Chris Dzombak
Accidental Bread?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, I would love to talk about bread, actually.

Chris Dzombak
Let's talk about bread for just a little bit, and then maybe we'll segue into your horrible approach to project management.

Soroush Khanlou
People on the Internet are very upset about my project management.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, there's a great Twitter thread to throw in show notes. So I decided I'm off this week. The university working for U of M the university to shut down this week between Christmas and New Year's, which is actually this is great. None of my other jobs so far have given me this entire week just off, so I'm really enjoying that. I decided that I was going to try to bake some bread. So yesterday, after I got back from my parents house, I put together the ingredients for the Mark Bitman's or the New York Times cooking no Need Bread recipe, which is supposed to be pretty simple. I tried it a while ago, and it didn't rise quite enough. And so this time I used a tiny bit more yeast, and I'm waiting longer for it to rise. So after we are done recording here, it will have been about 18 hours, and I'll go do whatever's next. It's definitely getting bigger in that bowl.

Soroush Khanlou
Nice.

Chris Dzombak
Very noticeably nice.

Soroush Khanlou
Okay. So what I would say is it rising is a function of a few things. I have this particular page of a book that I will send you.

Chris Dzombak
Okay.

Soroush Khanlou
Actually, I can send it to you right now.

Chris Dzombak
I have it handy via we're talking slack, I think.

Soroush Khanlou
I'm which would you like? You just got to tell me.

Chris Dzombak
It doesn't matter. Slack works.

Soroush Khanlou
Cool, right?

Chris Dzombak
So this is only the second loaf of bread that I have tried to make. And so I'm really not sure I don't know what all the variables are, what pitfalls I should be avoiding, that kind of thing.

Soroush Khanlou
The really nice thing about this little one pager is it tells you it's from a book, and it tells you basically all of the possible pitfalls you could have. Like, if you have too small of holes, this could be your problem. If you have too big of holes, these could be your problem, and so on, which is really nice.

Chris Dzombak
What do you mean, like bubbles in the bread?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, exactly.

Chris Dzombak
How do I know if they're too big or too small?

Soroush Khanlou
Well, have you seen other bread?

Chris Dzombak
No, this is my first bread.

Soroush Khanlou
Well, but, like, you've eaten bread before?

Chris Dzombak
First time bread? Yes, I have eaten bread before.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. So you just base it on basically other bread. What this one pager says? Poor volume. Could be too much salt, too little yeast, too little liquid, weak flour. Under or over mixing oven. Too hot.

Chris Dzombak
Under or over mixing. Okay.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, it's a very fiddly process. But essentially there's a couple of things that you should know. One is that the New York Times recipe is pretty good. The trick is that Dutch oven because it keeps all the steam in there. That part's really important.

Chris Dzombak
I did use one of those last time. I don't remember exactly. But looking at this chart right now, I think that my problem was probably it could have been too much salt. It could have been under or over mixing, because I have no idea how much I'm supposed to mix this.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, I would guess it's cold there and inside your house is probably not super warm.

Chris Dzombak
It's probably in the have a temperature hydrometer thing somewhere, but I don't know where.

Soroush Khanlou
The routes of humidity.

Chris Dzombak
Okay. 70 degrees Fahrenheit and 20% to 20% humidity.

Soroush Khanlou
70 is is on the cool side for bread, but it just means you just got to leave it for longer. You can do a cold proof in the fridge, which is 40 to 50 degrees. But as you said, like, you left for 18 hours, you just have to leave it for a long time and then yeah. So there's also this texture and crumb. Too dense or close grain. Too much salt, too little liquid. Too little yeast. Those are probably not your issue because you're following a recipe underfermented, which I think was your problem. And then underproofed or sorry, underproofed, I think is your problem. Under fermented is slightly different. I don't know if you've learned the difference between fermenting and proofing yet.

Chris Dzombak
I notice that this is page 40, and it seems to be a chapter titled Understanding Yeast Doughs. I don't even know what fermentation and proofing mean in this context.

Soroush Khanlou
Fermentation is essentially your first rise and proofing is your second rise.

Chris Dzombak
So after I do this, I'm supposed to do something like fold this over and then wait another 2 hours?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, that fold over is the distinction between fermentation.

Chris Dzombak
Okay. So proofing is that next 2 hours before I put it in the oven.

Soroush Khanlou
Exactly.

Chris Dzombak
Okay. All right, cool. So this chart will even let me tell which of these two rising periods I left it for. Too long or too little.

Soroush Khanlou
Exactly. Yeah. It's a pretty good little table. I use it and I send it to friends when they are having trouble debugging their bread.

Chris Dzombak
And debugging, I hopefully will not be literally debugging. What book is this from?

Soroush Khanlou
So this is from Professional Baking, the 6th edition by Wayne Gleason.

Chris Dzombak
Okay.

Soroush Khanlou
It's a weird little book. I collect antique not antique, but like cookbooks from the in addition to looking really cool, they sometimes also have useful information in them. And this is an example of one that does both. Yeah.

Chris Dzombak
What kind of notes are you keep if you bake a loaf of bread, what kind of notes are you keeping? Like, are you recording the temperature and exactly how long you left it for fermentation and proofing and all that so that you can go back to those notes when diagnosing a fault? Or are you like I'm very much like I haven't recorded any of that. I'm really kind of winging it here.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. So I did have a notebook for a while, and I would write down the exact recipe because I was tweaking the recipe here and there. I was having a lot of trouble with my first few breads as I proofed them. They were in a little cloth bowl, and when I flipped them, they would stick to the cloth bowl and that would, like, mega deflate them and so they come out like pancakes. It turns out that I needed rice flour because rice flour doesn't have any gluten in it and that prevents any basically, like, gluey stuff from forming, which won't cause it to stick to this lid and thing. So I had a number of problems. That was the primary one. But I was taking all kinds of notes, copious notes, trying to figure out what did I do wrong? So essentially, I would write down the exact recipe because I was tweaking it, adding more water, adding more flour, changing the whole wheat to white wheat ratio. That was one. And then the times of how long I would proof and then the temperature of the bread at which I was proofing. The temperature, the ambient temperature is important, but the actual thing that's, like, affecting your bread is the temperature of the bread itself. And so you'll find some bread nerds that are really sensitive about if their flour is a certain temperature, then they will add warmer water to the dough when they mix it. That's how intense they are about fixing the temperature.

Chris Dzombak
And that totally makes sense, right?

Soroush Khanlou
Exactly. What I end up usually doing is I have a folding proofer. And so what it is, is it's this box that folds up into something pretty flat. Yeah, we'll put a link to it in the show notes. It's a little on the expensive side. It's about $150, but I make enough bread that it is actually worth it, I think. And what it does is it can keep that little box to be an ambient temperature. So you can keep it really warm for, like, in 150 degree range for yogurts, but I keep it around 80 degrees for proofing, and that makes sure I get really consistent results without having to mess with water temperature or, like, especially for beginners. Once you get a feel for the bread, you know when it's ready, but when you're starting out, it's a little bit harder to know when it's ready. So it's a little bit of a fancy gadget, but it folds down flat, and it makes really good bread. And all it does is proof. It doesn't actually bake the bread. It just helps you proof the bread.

Chris Dzombak
So I'm thinking here in lieu of a folding proofer, which I probably am not going to buy, and I don't know where I would keep it in my kitchen if I did. My stove has pilot lights, so it's always just kind of fairly warm over the stove, even when I'm not cooking anything, even when the burners aren't turned on. So maybe just like having the bread sit on top of there where it's a little bit warmer, would be a nice fix for making bread, at least in the winter.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. Another trick that people often do is they will turn on the oven light, which actually emits a decent amount of heat, and then just put it in the oven.

Chris Dzombak
Okay, that works.

Soroush Khanlou
And that actually will get you kind of in an ambient warm range.

Chris Dzombak
That would work. And I mean, again, my oven, it has a pilot light. I don't have a light for illumination. What do you call a not pilot light?

Soroush Khanlou
There's an oven light.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, there's no oven light. There's no lamp in there. But it is kind of warm in there, again, because of pilot lights.

Soroush Khanlou
Okay, yeah, that might be the option. The other thing is you just do a cold proof, and you actually get better fermented flavors with the cold proof. So you get more tang, more sourdough.

Chris Dzombak
Oh, okay. Yeah, man, there's a lot here.

Soroush Khanlou
There is a whole, whole world I would recommend if you're going to get into it properly, there's this whole thing of sourdough and keeping your mother dough alive. The book I really like is the Tartine Bread book. It taught me almost everything I know, and that's the book I would recommend if you really, really want to get into this stuff.

Chris Dzombak
I think for now I'm probably going to just try to get the no need bread recipe working pretty well for me. If this doesn't work out, I'll figure out what to tweak and try to keep better notes, at least for now.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, makes sense. Yeah. How did your crust come out? Was it crunchy?

Chris Dzombak
It was crunchy. Yeah, the crust came out okay. Really? The problem was poor volume, I think.

Soroush Khanlou
Poor volume bubbles.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. I also used too much flour just on the part where it's sitting on a towel. And so there was just a ton of flour sitting on the crust. And I think that can be okay.

Soroush Khanlou
That actually can be like kind of like an artisanal touch.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, maybe it was a lot of flour. I'm going to try a little bit less nice. It says generously. Coat a cotton towel with flour. I did it very generously. I think I could do it just generously and it would be okay.

Soroush Khanlou
Nice. And if you do rice flour, you can use a little less and have even less sticking.

Chris Dzombak
I'd have to go to the grocery store between in the next 2 hours, though.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, that probably won't happen. Yeah, we got a podcast to do.

Chris Dzombak
That's right. So for listeners who are very, very confused right now, we should note that we decided to change up the format a little bit for this season. For season four.

Soroush Khanlou
That's right. Instead of doing like one topic per episode, we're going to try something a little bit more flexible. We were frankly running out of topics and we didn't really know if we had 20 more topics for another season in front of us. So we decided to do something a little bit more free form where we just kind of hop on, talk about the things that we were working on that week, maybe talk about a couple of side topics, a little bread. If this six month season is just like Chris's bread journey where we kind of check in on your bread every couple of every week. So that would be kind of fun. But yeah, we'll talk about some unrelated stuff and then we'll talk about some of the programming stuff that we've been up to that week. And I think I'm excited about this format. Chris, I don't know how you feel.

Chris Dzombak
I'm excited about it too. And like you said, this really is because I know that a lot of you, a lot of our listeners really appreciated the in depth technical topics that we were covering, especially like, early in season one, there just aren't too many of those. There aren't like 20 more of those that Seruch and I really feel confident that we can talk about for a really long time. And so we're going to try something a little more free form where we like, sir, just talk about what's going on in our programming lives, what's going on at work, what's going on outside of that. And this is when sir and I talk to each other. We don't really get a chance to catch up outside of this podcast very often, and hopefully it works. And please send us your feedback. Please let us know what you think, and we will change it as necessary as time goes on.

Soroush Khanlou
Would you talk about Patreon?

Chris Dzombak
I guess, yeah. So for those of you who are just joining us, or for those of you who have forgotten about this or hadn't heard, we have a Patreon.

Soroush Khanlou
That's right. Patreon is basically how we pay for this podcast to be made. It's how we pay for editing, it's how we pay for our gear. And if you want to support us there, you can go to patreon. Comfataleror. And when you pledge to the Patreon, you get an extra new RSS feed that not only contains all the episodes that you'll be hearing on the public feed, it also contains a bunch of episodes that are on the private feed. So every odd numbered episode is going to be here on this public feed. And then there will also be even numbered episodes, as well as the odd numbered episodes in the private feed, which are Patreon only. I feel like that was a bad way to explain the Patreon, but there you have it.

Chris Dzombak
If you subscribe to our Patreon every other week, the episode is only for Patreon subscribers, is what Sirish is trying to say.

Soroush Khanlou
Yes, you get twice as many episodes. It's a pretty good deal.

Chris Dzombak
It's great. So with bread, the format and Patreon out of the way, we can finally.

Soroush Khanlou
Talk about the real stuff.

Chris Dzombak
Sarosh, what are you doing with notes?

Soroush Khanlou
Okay, here's the deal. Was our previous productivity episode Patreon only or not? I can't remember.

Chris Dzombak
I think it might have been well.

Soroush Khanlou
I think it was two.

Chris Dzombak
Well, I guess we should figure that out.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. 48. Okay, so episode 48, we talked about productivity. I have a tough time with productivity. I can't find productivity tools that really work for me. Now, this was a Patreon episode, but basically, to recap, chris switched from Omni Focus to Things. And I was kind of finally, after maybe five years, admitting that Things does not work for me. I spent a bunch of money on Things. I spent a bunch of money on Omni Focus trying to commit to those platforms, and I never got them to really work for me. I could not remember to put stuff in. I didn't remember to take stuff out, and I didn't remember to do the reviews and the organizing and the tagging and the sorting, and I didn't add due dates to stuff, and I just wasn't taking advantage of the platforms because I just wasn't doing the work that it required to make it useful.

Chris Dzombak
Sure. And I mean, for all my jokey, like, what are you doing using Notes? The important thing with any of this, which I think I mentioned in the previous episode about this, is that you find something that works for you. I was really kind of struggling to get Omni Focus to work for me. Things really tends to line up with the way that my mind wants to organize my days and keep track of things. And if you're finding something that works well with another app, Notes, or something else, then that's great, and you should do it.

Soroush Khanlou
Right. So as far as finding something that works for you, I really, actually have, which I'm really excited about. Notes is crushing it.

Chris Dzombak
And so I know that Apple has put some effort into Notes over the last several years. I understand that there are maybe folders now and that there's some sort of, like, to do list support in Notes. Is that correct?

Soroush Khanlou
Yes. So basically, Notes is now pretty rich text. Like, the text that you can generate is pretty rich. So the key features that you need to make this thing work for you are you need folders which they added. You can kind of instead of making bulleted lists or numbered lists, you can make, like, checkbox lists, and they're really nicely rendered. You could tap on them and all that stuff. And so what I've done is basically all my reference documents. So that's like, stuff like my routing number for my bank, the speaker bio that I sent to conferences, various recipes, things I want to remember that are like, long term. Those go into they're still in the Notes section. You can't delete that Notes folder, which is I would like to rename it Reference, but you can't do that. Okay. So those stay there. And then I made a new project called new folder called Projects. And then I made a new folder called Archive. And I made a new folder called Long Running.

Chris Dzombak
Okay, I like where this is going.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. So basically, Projects holds all of my current running projects. Those can be small in scale. I have one called cleaning. I have a friend visiting, and I need to clean the apartment before he gets here. Or I have one that's video editing, which is like a six month project that's like a big, long project.

Chris Dzombak
What's the goal of the video editing project? Like, how will you know when that's done? Or is it just sort of in Omni Focus parlance an area of responsibility?

Soroush Khanlou
It's a little bit more like an area of responsibility. The nice thing is that it's not getting things done. So you don't necessarily have to have I do like to have action items, but you don't necessarily have to have a goal for each project to say that this project is done. It can kind of just be like a running list of like, this is some stuff that needs to happen.

Chris Dzombak
Okay.

Soroush Khanlou
And the video editing probably should move to long running, which is where my blog post list is. Again, those are things that do need to get done, but they're never going to be done as a project.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, totally.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. So basically once things are finished in terms of the projects, they go into the archive and then long running is right now it's like blog posts, what movies I want to watch, and that way I can keep track of like, oh, I saw cool trailer. Let me throw that in there. The nice thing about it is there's absolutely no structure that's enforced upon you. So you have titles, headers, and then like these checklists. So instead of having to wait whatever it was six years for Things to add headers into their to do lists as like a feature, it's just text. So you can just add headers wherever you want. Yeah, you can add attachments as well, which you actually cannot do in Things. So you can't add an image attachment. I don't know if you can do that in Omni Focus.

Chris Dzombak
You can do that in Omni focus. And that's one of few features that I miss in Things compared to Omni Focus. Just sorry to interject, but one of the other things that I miss in Things that I wish I could do is attach notes to area in Things. You can attach notes to projects, but for whatever reason, you can't attach them to what's it called? Area.

Soroush Khanlou
Like a line item to an area.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. So I can add a note. I can't find a good example here, but you can add just sort of project notes to a project. But if you have just like a general, I don't know, like reading list area you can't attach notes to, that interesting.

Soroush Khanlou
I never thought to do that.

Chris Dzombak
And it doesn't I don't understand why. I'm pretty sure that you can do this in Omni Focus. And obviously if I were using a more free form notes or I really like the bare application for notes and keeping just plain text reference material.

Soroush Khanlou
Right.

Chris Dzombak
Obviously this would be something that I would not be annoying me in there because I could just add notes as I need to.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, because it's just text.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. Being able to mix things in without much structure would be very nice.

Soroush Khanlou
Right? Yeah. So, yeah, if you like bear and bear is your jam, do that. I didn't want to pay a dollar a month for my thing, especially for my to do app when Notes was probably going to work pretty well. The other thing about Notes, that Things and Omni Focus can't give you is collaboration. So you can actually share a note with another person and put a to do list in there for both of you. And so that's really cool. So me and my girlfriend can have a shared shopping list where if we just put stuff on there, and then whoever goes to the shopping list can go to the shopping, go do the shopping, and check off the items on that list.

Chris Dzombak
Nice.

Soroush Khanlou
So that's something that you totally can't even do. In addition, attaching map links to places. So I have a project where there's a couple of stores in the city I got to go to or like, errands, that kind of thing. I can add actual map links and then you can tap on those. They open, and you can get directions and do whatever you need to do from there.

Chris Dzombak
Cool.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. So it's pretty good. It's got a lot of features that things that Omni Focus don't have. It is also, of course, missing some features.

Chris Dzombak
What are those features do you find yourself missing? Because I think a lot of the one of the main advantages, it sounds like with Notes is the sort of unstructured nature that comes with it. And a lot of the things in Omni Focus features really are possible because of the structure that comes with them. And sort of keeping up with that structure was something that you found you just weren't doing for one reason or another. Right, right. So what do you wish you had in Notes that Omni Focus or things could do for you?

Soroush Khanlou
There are things that I wish that I had, but not that many of them. So, for example, if you are a kind of person who likes to attach due dates to projects and you want your phone to ping you when that due date rolls around, if you want to be able to sort by due date, or if you want to be able it is ultimately just text. So you can't do stuff like that. Or how Omni Focus has you can kind of set geofences and you can say, alert me about this to do item when I get to this geofence. You can't do that. The nice thing is reminders still does exist. So you can use reminders for the time and the time and place based to do items that you have, and that can be kind of nice.

Chris Dzombak
Is there any sort of integration between reminders and notes within the Apple ecosystem? Like, if you're looking at a note, can you say, Remind me about this in five days?

Soroush Khanlou
No, actually, that's a good question. I bet you can do that. But there's no other integrations that I'm aware of.

Chris Dzombak
Okay. Because I know that Apple has been adding the remind me about whatever I'm looking at on the screen in five days. And that uses what's the API that that uses activities, I think NS activity, maybe? Is it activity? I don't know. I'm not an iOS developer anymore. I don't know.

Soroush Khanlou
I think it's UI Activity.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. And it's the same thing that powers, like, handoff between devices.

Soroush Khanlou
No, it's not UI activity. It's something. It's definitely something.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, we'll Google handoff after this show. Notes.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, we're really bad programmers. But I'm just a productivity guru now, so I'm not actually responsible for that's.

Chris Dzombak
Right.

Soroush Khanlou
NS user activity.

Chris Dzombak
That's it. Yeah, that's the one.

Soroush Khanlou
NS user activity.

Chris Dzombak
Anyway, basically for free. For apps that support handoff, you can get this, like, remind me about this in a couple of days. And I'm wondering if Notes supports that.

Soroush Khanlou
An NS User Activity Object provides a lightweight way to capture the state of your app and put it to use later.

Chris Dzombak
Kind of like a Glorified dictionary, right?

Soroush Khanlou
More or less.

Chris Dzombak
I guess that describes most objects, a Glorified dictionary.

Soroush Khanlou
And my productivity system is just a glorified Notes app.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. And so you've been doing this for a while now, right?

Soroush Khanlou
Maybe like two months now.

Chris Dzombak
Okay, that's working well.

Soroush Khanlou
It's working pretty well. One of the other things that's really nice about it is all of the hotkeys and key commands that you're comfortable with on the keyboard for editing text in iOS just work right. So you can do something like triple click a line to select the whole line, drag down to select multiple lines of any to do list, and then I'll do a quick, like, command x command to cut, command n to create a new Note command v to paste. So now those items have moved to a new list, and then I'll quickly drag that over to the archive folder, and then those items in that list are now, like, archived. So you can kind of archive part of a list very quickly just because you're familiar with how to navigate through text in iOS. It's not like a force situation where if your to do list application doesn't support hitting Enter to leave this line of this to do item and create a new to do item underneath it, things does support that, but other ones don't. And so if that's not there, then you feel like, oh, I can't really maneuver through this list the way I'd want. It's just text, so you can just maneuver through it any way you want. And all your hotkeys of editing text, of grabbing multiple lines, I could say holding shift and hitting down to get one line at a time, all that stuff just works. And you can really quickly move stuff around and manipulate it in a way that you're really familiar with.

Chris Dzombak
Cool. Yeah. I'd throw in on OS Ten. Something I've done in the past when I was using NV Alt is to basically add features for common operations. You can write Apple scripts and use something like Fast scripts to activate them and basically send whatever keyboard shortcut sequence you need to accomplish your goal. That is.

Soroush Khanlou
A really good idea.

Chris Dzombak
So, like in NVALT, every note is backed by a file on just a text file on the file system. And so to move things to, like an archive folder when I was done, rather than right clicking the note and saying Show in Finder and then dragging it to the archive folder, I created an apple script that just did that, but via Apple script. Like, open this, show this note in Finder, move it to the archive folder, close that finder window, switch back to envialt. And if there are repetitive actions like that that you find yourself doing, that may be an avenue to explore.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, for sure. That is, I would say, the number one thing that I miss about a more traditional to do app, which is that it has hotkeys for doing stuff.

Chris Dzombak
You can just write your own to do app in Apple script.

Soroush Khanlou
That's right. This is a genius idea because that is how Omni Focus started. Did you know that?

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, absolutely. Omni Focus started because a bunch of people had put together more and more complex Apple scripts for managing an Omni Outliner document to keep track of tasks in the GTD system. And Omni saw that and decided to make a whole separate application. So now people are no longer, or by and large, no longer have to use Apple script plus Omni Outliner as a to do list.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, that's right. It's called GTD kinkless.

Chris Dzombak
Oh, okay. I didn't know that.

Soroush Khanlou
GTD kinkless. Don't Kink shame me.

Chris Dzombak
I'm not. Whatever. You want to use notes, that's fine.

Soroush Khanlou
This stuff is really old. This stuff is from, like, the mid 2000s. I'll put a link to it in the show Notes so that you can kind of kick off your own little search and exploration about it. But for the most part, this stuff has all been replaced by Omni Focus. But this is how it all started.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, really old mid 2000s.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, so old. We were all little babies back then. Yeah, but yeah, so that's basically what I've been doing for productivity.

Chris Dzombak
Okay. Yeah. I'm glad you found something that is working for you.

Soroush Khanlou
So people on the Internet, they got really upset about it.

Chris Dzombak
Well, and we can add a note to that thread. People on the Internet are going to be upset. And that's why I said before, the important thing is that something's working for you. We're not prescribing that this exact setup is going to work for anyone else. Just like Things doesn't work for everyone and Omni Focus doesn't work for everyone. You know, whatever works for you works for you.

Soroush Khanlou
And that is frankly how I felt. I felt like I was being prescribed Omni Focus. I was like, this doesn't work with my brain. I can't bring myself to do daily reviews. Like, who's got the time for daily reviews? And I couldn't even do weekly reviews. I was like, some weeks I'm not here some weeks I am here. How can I schedule this?

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, my Omni Focus usage devolved into every four monthly reviews, which I don't think is how it's supposed to work.

Soroush Khanlou
No, I don't think so either. So basically what happened was that we were at iOS IRL, and I was kind of talking about this, and Matt Bishop kind of overheard me, and I didn't say these words exactly, but the gist of what I was saying was that Notes is Omni Focus kind of in a slightly trolling manner. So he tweeted that, and people got really upset, and they were like, what's going on? What's happening? But, yeah, it's, like, actually working. Oh, also, let's not forget that in Notes, you can now scan stuff, and the scanning is actually super good. You can sketch stuff. I don't think you could sketch stuff in Omni Focus, my friend. You can only do that in Notes.

Chris Dzombak
Well, that's true. You can't. You could attach an image of something that you sketched to something in Omni.

Soroush Khanlou
Focus, and you could also pin Notes to the top. So I have a running list of, like these are the things that I'm up to. It's titled as early December. It's kind of late December now, so I can just go ahead and update that title. But yeah, I just, like there's no prescription about there's no, like, if you want to make a note about three things you want to cook next week, you can do that. It's just a note. And there's no, like it's not a project. It has a completion date and, like or whatever. It's just some things. Some things that you're writing down to remember.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, that's great.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. So I think you could do similar stuff in Bear. I've never really used Bear in any serious way.

Chris Dzombak
I do really like bear. I've been using it not really for to do lists, because I'm using things for that, but just for general notes, keeping reference information around. Maybe if there's something, like, three things I'm thinking about cooking that goes in Bear. It is a really nice app. It's really well done. I love that it's markdown based and synchronization, works better than almost any other app that I've used. It's a very nice product. I have to give it a shout out here.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. I hear a lot of good things about Bear. Maybe I should look into Bear.

Chris Dzombak
And again, if Notes is working for you, then it's working for you.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. Don't mess with something that works.

Chris Dzombak
That's right.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. Cool. Should we wrap up?

Chris Dzombak
I think so. I have two more bits that I want to throw into this episode.

Soroush Khanlou
Absolutely.

Chris Dzombak
First, how is your server doing?

Soroush Khanlou
Oh, not good. No, not bad. Have we talked about this on the show yet?

Chris Dzombak
No, I don't think we have. But it came up in the Twitter thread about Notes being Omni Focus.

Soroush Khanlou
That's right. It totally did. So essentially what happened was that a few months ago, my server got hacked by Chinese hackers. They basically brute forced it. They figured out the root password and I know don't at me. You're not supposed to have root enabled on SSH. I know, but I had a good password limiting. Yeah, I feel like it should come standard. Anyway, I thought I had a good password. It was like seven characters, not an English word number. Three numbers.

Chris Dzombak
Wait, seven characters?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, seven like letters, seven letters, three numbers and one punctuation. Okay, what was in English word anyway? I thought it was a good password. Eleven characters, not a good password. So I basically tried to fix my server and I succeeded for a while, changed the root password, they were locked out. But then I got these updates from Rackspace that my server was actually DDoSing Sony, so it was part of a giant botnet, which wasn't good, and so I had to transfer everything off of it and most of the things that were on there were static sites. So I moved them all to GitHub Pages and shut down my server, which is good, but GitHub pages doesn't support plugins, which I need for a few of the things that I do, including tag pages on my blog. So if you try to go to tag pages on my blog in the last few weeks, you've noticed that they don't work. So I have one project here that says called Fixed Server and the first line item is get linode instance. So that's my first step to getting this server back up and running.

Chris Dzombak
I'll throw a couple of links about putting together a good SSH set up in the show notes, too.

Soroush Khanlou
One of these line items is give it a big tough password.

Chris Dzombak
If you think you can deal with doing public key authentication only, not password based SSH auth that will oh, that's a really good idea. Yeah, that makes it I mean, you could set a much longer password. You can use fail to ban to make it so that people can't effectively brute force the password and or you can just make it so that you can only log in with a public key, not with a password at all.

Soroush Khanlou
Got you. Yeah, fail to ban would have been really helpful because I tailed the logs and it was like more than a month that they were just hammering the server just trying to guess the password. They were just slamming it.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, but those are my that advice plus disabling root log and vssh. That's the minimum viable steps to keep this from happening in the future.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, I mean, I think just failed to ban would have solved this particular problem.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, definitely. But defense in depth. Those three steps should make it should absolutely keep this from happening again.

Soroush Khanlou
Defense in depth.

Chris Dzombak
That's right.

Soroush Khanlou
Good. That's pretty good.

Chris Dzombak
You said you have one other second note. Do you ever use a do Not Disturb mode on your iPhone? On your iPhone X.

Soroush Khanlou
My X is doing well. Okay. So I do actually something a little bit unorthodox. Shout out to Ben Rice McCarthy for teaching me this trick. So what I do is in the sound and Haptics preferences, there are two options vibrate on ring and vibrate on silent. And I actually turned off vibrate on silent. And so when my phone is on vibrate, like when the mute switch is off, it makes no sounds. So what that means is I have like instant physical access to Do Not Disturb more or less.

Chris Dzombak
That's interesting. This also means that wait, so this means that you don't have a mode where your phone just vibrates and doesn't make noise though?

Soroush Khanlou
That's right. Because my thinking is anytime there's, like, no situation where I want my phone to vibrate but not make noise. Like if I'm in the movie theater, you don't need to vibrate, because then it'll just stress me out, and then I'll have to look at it and somebody's going to yell at me. Or if I'm in a meeting, I shouldn't be checking my phone. It just stays in the pocket. So that's how I do it. And then I have full on mode, which is and then the other interesting part is it's almost always on silent, so it actually just barely ever makes any noise.

Chris Dzombak
That's interesting.

Soroush Khanlou
It's not like Do Not Disturb in a few ways because the screen still turns on, which I don't think it does, for Do Not Disturb, and then calls can't punch through it the way they can with Do Not Disturb.

Chris Dzombak
Right.

Soroush Khanlou
So with DND, either VIPs or people that call multiple times can punch through.

Chris Dzombak
Right.

Soroush Khanlou
And this doesn't support that.

Chris Dzombak
Okay, I'll think about this. I don't know if I'm sold, but this is an interesting idea.

Soroush Khanlou
Do you have a do not disturb scheme?

Chris Dzombak
I have a Do Not Disturb complaint, which is that where on all the other devices which don't have notches, when you turn on Do Not Disturb, there is a little icon that shows up up in the status bar on the iPhone X. The little moon doesn't show up in the status bar. There's no indication that you're in do not disturb mode.

Soroush Khanlou
It's really annoying.

Chris Dzombak
And so it's really annoying. There have been several days now when it's three in the afternoon and I realize I've missed calls and texts because my phone's been in Do Not Disturb since the previous night at like eleven at night.

Soroush Khanlou
Right.

Chris Dzombak
And I just forget to turn it off because there's no reminder to do that. And I googled around to see if there are anything you can do to get an icon to show up. And it's just a bunch of people complaining about the same thing. I wonder if maybe I can set Do Not Disturb to always turn off at a certain time. I don't want it to turn on at a certain time? Always. But I have an idea.

Soroush Khanlou
What if you set it to turn on automatically at 630 and turn off at seven?

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, that could work. Or, like, turn on at 04:00 A.m.? Because if I'm ever awake at 04:00 A.m., I should not be something's definitely wrong already. Yeah, maybe I'll try that. That's an idea. But yeah, it's been rough. Let me tell you. My life is I believe it.

Soroush Khanlou
I also have a similar status bar complaint, which is that the network activity indicator now doesn't show up.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah.

Soroush Khanlou
Ever.

Chris Dzombak
So it's like, is that really a problem?

Soroush Khanlou
I have one specific situation where I do like it on. Okay, so you're in Tweetbot, you load up a thread. It's something controversial, something political, and you're looking at the reply. The reply seems juicy and the original Tweet seems even juicier, but Tweetbot doesn't tell you it doesn't have any indication that it's loading that previous Tweet. And so you just kind of have to pull down on the little scroll view and keep it stretched until it loads to see when it actually pops in. Now, with the network activity indicator, you could tell it was doing something, so maybe it was loading that thing, but once the activity indicator stopped, you knew. Okay, well, this person deleted it because it was too spicy, and now it's no longer fit for public consumption. So I'm never going to get to read it. I'm going to go find their enemies and find somebody who screenshotted that Tweet so that I can actually look at it.

Chris Dzombak
This sounds like a Tweet bot problem, not an iOS problem.

Soroush Khanlou
It is a Tweet bot problem. Yes, but I used to use iOS to fix it, and now iOS has taken that away from me.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, I guess that's fair. Tweetbot also just doesn't handle threads very well.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, it's not great. I think it's partially the API's fault.

Chris Dzombak
I'm sure it is. Yeah.

Soroush Khanlou
Last note is if you open Control Center, you'll see all of the icons in the status bar there. And I know that's not immediately obvious, that's not perfect of a solution, but that is a solution.

Chris Dzombak
Well, if I open Control Center, I'll also see that the do not disturb thing is selected.

Soroush Khanlou
That's also fair. That's definitely fair.

Chris Dzombak
By the time I've gotten here, it's no longer an issue. All right, I'll try some scheduling related Tweaks and report back.

Soroush Khanlou
Sounds good. Sounds good. So this has been our productivity podcast.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah.

Soroush Khanlou
We hope you've enjoyed it.

Chris Dzombak
Tune in this time next week for some hot Apple script. Ticks, ticks, got chip.

Soroush Khanlou
Ticks and trips.

Chris Dzombak
Ticks and trips from sirous.

Soroush Khanlou
Ticks and trips. We mentioned this on the private the Patreon episode that we did, kind of in mid December. But the breaks are always so hard because we go so long without talking to each other, and I'm bursting with things to share with you.

Chris Dzombak
I know. Me too. I've never told you about my espresso machine.

Soroush Khanlou
Oh, boy. Topic of next episode espresso machines.

Chris Dzombak
Excellent.

Soroush Khanlou
I have a great hot chocolate recipe using the steam wand of an espresso machine.

Chris Dzombak
I am an need to hear this.

Soroush Khanlou
Absolutely. Until next week.

Chris Dzombak
Talk to you later.

Soroush Khanlou
Bye, Chris. Bye.
