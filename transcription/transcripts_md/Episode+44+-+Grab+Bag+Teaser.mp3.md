That zip file consists just of, like, your JavaScript file or files and your Node Modules folder, right? Because AWS Lambda isn't going to download node modules for you. They have to be all packed up in the. Zip file.

Speaker B
Got you. So that zip file might be tens of thousands of gigabytes, potentially, with all your Node modules in there. That's right. Got to get those settled.

Speaker A
I have a very small project so far, and I think my no Modules file folder is up at, like, seven megabytes right now.

Speaker B
So you're joking.

Speaker A
I'm not.

Speaker B
Wow. It's all code. It's not like there's any images in there. It's not like there's any video. There's no data. That's crazy.

Speaker A
Yeah, it's possible to on the other hand, I don't really write much JavaScript and certainly much Node, but I've gotten this working so far pretty quickly, so that's cool.
