Speaker A
If it's something where you won't be able to adopt it and if the project is abandoned or you have to make some small change, you're going to end up rewriting it anyway, then it's probably not a good choice to bring it in. But if it seems like it's something you could probably build on if requirements change, then in my book it's probably a good move to at least think about bringing that into your project.

Speaker B
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, listening to you, I'm just like thinking about all the horrible ways that could go wrong. When you take a library like that, you're assuming that any way that you would want it to change essentially has to be an option in the library. Like it has to be coded in as like something that's parameterized or you'll.

Speaker A
Code it in and send a pull request. And how's that different from code that you wrote that didn't anticipate this use case? You're going to end up going in and changing it anyway then.

Speaker B
Right, but changing the code that you wrote is easier. One, because you wrote it, two, because you have access like the code is.
