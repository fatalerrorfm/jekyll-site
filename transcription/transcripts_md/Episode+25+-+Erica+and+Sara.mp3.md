Speaker A
Hello, and welcome to another episode of Fatal Error. I'm Siresh Khanwood. And I'm Chris De Zomback, and we have a very special episode for you all this week. We have two guests with us. We have Erica Gutierrez.

Speaker B
Hey.

Speaker A
And we have Sarah Ahmed.

Speaker B
Hi. Thank you for having us.

Speaker A
Yeah, we're very happy to have you on. Sarah and Erica have been have worked their way through a coding boot camp, and they're starting to navigate the waters of our industry. And we kind of wanted to talk a little bit about what getting that first job is like, what the industry can look like to an outsider, and a couple of topics like that. Yeah, I just want to hear a little bit about your experience through the boot camp and your job search so far. So maybe just to start, do one of you want to tell us a little bit about your background?

Speaker B
So before coming into the coding boot camp, I was managing the database in a small company, and often I had to do with Excel and doing some small coding thing. And I started to play around with coding some minor stuff like HTML and CSS, and I started to wonder if maybe I should switch to some learning how to code and started to do some research. I did some online classes, the free ones, and I started to think that I spend most of my time on my iPhone, so I wanted to learn how to do apps.

Speaker A
Cool.

Speaker B
And I started to research about coding boot camps in the United States, but I wanted to stay in New York, so I mainly did my research for New York City boot camps, and I landed in one of them called Flat Iron School, and I did the iOS immersive during the summer. And since then, I've been trying to find a junior developer role, and it hasn't been that easy, so that's where I'm at now. Meanwhile, I've been developing my skills and trying to network and see how the industry outside. So, yeah, that's about fair.

Speaker A
Okay. How long was the boot camp?

Speaker B
Three months.

Speaker A
Three months. And did you both go to the same boot camp? Same class, the same cohort? Got you. Okay. And Sarah, what's your story?

Speaker B
Basically, I always thought that I would go into medicine out of high school. I wanted to go to pharmacy school. Didn't have enough money, so I couldn't go. And then I went and I majored in nutrition, thinking I would go into medicine but have a holistic approach. And after I was rejected, I was just like, I'm not going to do this. And I saw a couple of documentaries. Didn't want to do it. Decided to go back to school, pursued computer science. I was just working full time and going to school full time. My main focus at the time was just paying my tuition, so I couldn't focus as much. I knew I wanted to do something with mobile development because that was the time that I had gotten a smartphone, and I thought it was amazing because I spent so much time on there. And so I was just like, I have to go into mobile development. After I finished up at my computer science degree, I learned C plus plus Java, but I was like, okay, I really want to do mobile development. That's when I had one interview. It went horrible. I realized I really had to have good skills to go into this. I applied to every boot camp under the sun and just I got into Flatiron, thankfully, and it was a great program, learned a lot, and I'm still learning, so I'm on this journey, I guess, as a student forever.

Speaker A
And what have you been up to since the bouquet?

Speaker B
I've been applying, working on coding challenges, working on my own projects, just trying and just networking. Also I run a meetup group called Tri Swift and I also attend a lot of meetups.

Speaker A
Tri Swift is actually where we met, right? Yes.

Speaker B
Because you were a speaker.

Speaker A
Yeah, there was a little bit. Was it Queen's College?

Speaker B
Yes, Queen's College.

Speaker A
Yeah, Queen's College. We went up there. That's where I met these two. I think you showed me your app there as well. No, it's like a movie app.

Speaker B
Oh, no, I talked about it.

Speaker A
Oh, you talked about it? You didn't show it? Can you tell us a little bit about what that app does?

Speaker B
So it's just a simple app that calls the Omtb API and populates a collection view using the URLs. You have pictures of the movies. You click on a cell, it takes you over, it gives you the details of the movies. And I was trying to add a soundtrack kind of component to it, calling the itunes API and then getting that. But I didn't get around to doing that because I've been working on coding challenges.

Speaker A
Erica, have you been working on any side projects or anything like that since you finished the boot camp?

Speaker B
So I did a similar project, which is a movie app, and also I'm also trying to do a restaurant app where you have a bucket list of which one you want to visit.

Speaker A
Cool.

Speaker B
Haven't had much time to do it because, again, I'm doing coach, challenging and studying, and it takes time.

Speaker A
Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker B
And also, Swift language is always changing, and sometimes some companies, they ask you for a jet to see, so I need to brush up on that too. So, yeah, finding the time sometimes is hard.

Speaker A
Has the sort of ever changing nature of the Swift language been a challenge for either of you? Like, coming into this industry at this particular point in time?

Speaker B
Well, when we went through the boot camp, we were learning Swift Two.

Speaker A
Okay.

Speaker B
And once we graduated, it was the switch to Swift Three, and we had to deal with at least I had to deal with changing the app that I was working at the time. How there's no more NS stuff. It's more like they took the NS and I was like, hey, I just learned this. Why are you taking that out? It's a legacy. It's history. There's history in it. But you grow and you just learn. Now I'm hearing that Swiss Four is coming and you have to do everything again.

Speaker A
They say Swift Four is going to be simpler. The transition is going to be a little easier, but God knows truly happens. Yeah, I think it's a particularly rough time, especially in that sense of like, objective C is not totally phased out yet. Swift Two there I think there are still people writing Swift Two, and a lot of people have moved to Swift Three, but it's just like it feels like a constant treadmill. Even for us. Having been in this for several years.

Speaker B
It seems like every year there's a.

Speaker A
New Swift kind of thing. Exactly.

Speaker B
You have to keep up for a new developer. You are learning to code and then learning a new language every time.

Speaker A
Right.

Speaker B
And you don't really have a background in coding.

Speaker A
I will say I think there are tons of New Yorkers that I know that have bucket lists for restaurants, and they would definitely use your app. Yeah, that would be cool. So you all mentioned you all done a couple of interviews since what's that process kind of been like?

Speaker B
It's been kind of a tough process because we're starting off as juniors. Right. I know it's not I can't say this we want, but it would be nice for someone to invest in us and give us that time. And if they invested in us, obviously we would invest that back into our code and we would make sure that we pushed an amazing app. That's what I want. At this point in time, I'm not even negotiating. Someone asked me, what are you looking for in terms of salary? And I'm just like, I'm looking for a learning experience. That's what I'm looking for. I'm looking to create an amazing app and push that out there and showcase my skills and learn. So I just want to push myself. So I just feel like a lot of people are very unforgiving of mistakes, and I just wish that they would invest in enough a little bit and give us that opportunity because we would return that back and show them that we represent your company and we want to make sure that you're represented the best way possible. I just feel like people need to start somewhere. People usually start somewhere. And my experience so far is, like many companies, they just want people with at least one year or two with experience just to start. And being someone that just graduated, I wish there were more, like internship or fellowship or some kind of apprenticeship where you can learn and grow. At the same time, I think big companies, especially, they have the resources, so why they don't have more program like this?

Speaker A
Yeah, it seems like very much a chicken and egg problem. Like, you can't get the experience without the job, you can't get the job without the experience.

Speaker B
And they're forgetting that they themselves, they start from somewhere and we just need an opportunity. And those junior developers, they want to grow up to be a senior developer. So once they land that senior role, you just need somebody else, more junior to fill that role. So it's like a ladder kind of thing, right? So you just need to give people some opportunities. And just last week I was on Twitter and ads from RC. He was talking about it like how some people, they just don't want to give junior more opportunities and there needs to be more mentors and people helping out, giving advice.

Speaker A
It's hard to kind of kick start that engine without some investment, sort of from the top down. One of the companies that I last contracted at, they were better at it than I think, most companies. And it was pretty much every senior had a corresponding junior that they worked with. And sometimes they had to pair program with them. Sometimes the junior would make something and in code review they would manage it. But that one to one ratio really felt like we were making developers better and we were also getting good code out the door as well. So that was a nice balance, I think, for us. Yeah, we at my current company do not have quite that balance. I think we're tilted a little bit more toward having mostly senior, at least a slight majority of more senior people. And we do have a number of us are remote, so we use Screen Hero for pair programming and things like that. But yeah, we're not quite as good about that now. And thinking about it, I'm not really sure why that is necessarily.

Speaker B
It also doesn't make sense because something that I know that we want more people to get into this field. I was reading an article by it's a pretty big company based in San Francisco, and they've grown in the past seven years, they've grown like a lot, and they were ten employees, and now they're like 400 employees in San Francisco. And I was recently interviewed by them and I read an article how they have only 11% of women in their company and now they want to push for 30. And then they have this apprenticeship program that's three people that they're willing to mentor. But at the same time, I feel like because there's a lot of things we're iOS developers, so we're focusing on iOS fundamentals and then there's algorithms. Out of all the classes that I've taken in college, whether that be biochemistry, molecular biology, whatever, mathematics programming is unlike anything that I've ever taken. You have to really change your mindset. You have to think, sir. You have to think a whole different way. And I wish people were more forgiving and would understand that we are trying to change our mindset. Please just help us. Just give us that opportunity. We're not here to say, okay, yeah, we're a developer. We're here for the salary. No, we're here to contribute and create great apps. Just give us that opportunity. And if you want diversity, then just we'll meet you halfway. Meet us halfway, please.

Speaker A
Yeah. Especially if you think the number of women in the industry is under is lower than you want it to be. I don't see how you can get those diversity numbers up without saying, we're also going to trade out people from.

Speaker B
A lower yeah, definitely. And now we're hearing that bigger companies are having problems with women. They're not like certain developers will because they happen to be male. They'll harass them or something and they'll sweep it under the rug.

Speaker A
Yeah.

Speaker B
So, I mean, it's unfortunate, but women are trying. We're really trying. Just give us an opportunity, please. I wonder if the fact that if people don't have a CS background that matters or not. It seems like for many companies they want to hire people with computer science background and they're not willing to give boot camp grads a chance. Mainly because they have bad past previous hiring from boot camps before, meaning that they are not really knowledgeable about the basics sometimes because some boot camps are, they've been pushing just graduates and not really forming them for a developer role. That's so unfortunate because I feel like I went through the computer science degree and I feel like I learned more at boot camp. I'm sorry. Colleges are great. I think colleges are great to learn theory, but when you go in and you're an iOS developer or Java developer, whatever, you're not going to sit there and say, hey, this is different between struct this is the difference between class no. You have to implement whatever it is and you have to know why you're implementing it, why that ties into whatever you have to do. I think it's horrible that people don't want to take boot campers because I learned more at a boot camp than I did in my computer science degree.

Speaker A
Yeah. Chris, do you have a computer science degree? So yeah, I have a computer science degree and yeah, I think half of what I know I learned at my first job after college. Not from that four year CS degree experience.

Speaker B
Exactly.

Speaker A
Yeah, I don't have a computer science degree, but yeah, it was the same. It was just like the first few apps I made, the first companies that I worked at was like, where I learned what I like, what I don't like, what I think works, what I think doesn't work. All that stuff came on the job. There was no computer science degree. Yeah, I've seen both. I've seen companies that have people with computer science degrees, people that don't have them. I'm not sure if there's like a balance that they try to strike or feel like interviewing. So much of it is so loosey goosey.

Speaker B
Yeah.

Speaker A
I'm sorry.

Speaker B
Go ahead.

Speaker A
Oh, I was just going to say I often feel like being on the hiring side of interviews sometimes. Now I feel like the interview and hiring process is slightly better than random, honestly, but often it's nowhere near as deterministic as we would like it to be. I think there's big companies also that have done research and written books about how the things we think affect hiring good people that will last a while at the company and provide good work for us are just not the things we thought they were.

Speaker B
Yeah, it's okay. I was just going to say there's also I don't know why there's this oh, we're not going to hire boot campers because they're not whatever. I don't know why people think that.

Speaker A
Yeah. In your experience, is that like boot camp specific or is it like junior developers in general?

Speaker B
Or do you know, every time that I've gone out to an interview and they've asked me like, oh, you have a computer science degree, why'd you go to a boot camp? I was like, Because I wanted to learn implementation, that's why. So that's something I have to clarify for them because I don't think creating an app or programming is spitting out facts. It's implementing code and understanding why you're implementing it. Right. Boot camp really helps with that, I think, from my experience, is junior developers coming from boot camps, usually many companies, they are now opening many roles for junior developers, but they want people from universities with computer science, just juniors and seniors and sophomore from universities. So I've been applying to some of them, trying to see if they can at least open one spot for a boot camper. And I've been getting some rejection just because I did not go to university and study computer science. So they will be, hey, I'm sorry, this is for college students. Maybe that's awful. Maybe next time we will open something for boot campers.

Speaker A
Yeah, I definitely heard the anti boot camp stuff at companies and it's kind of like, I don't know, I learned by making the worst app in the world. I don't know why that should be considered better than someone who actually went and learned from someone for three months. I don't know. Yeah, you're not hiring a degree. You're hiring someone with specific skills. That's not really an effective way to filter for those skills. Yeah.

Speaker B
Also, at the same time, I feel like a lot of junior positions, like you'll see a junior position, it'll be like you have to have three years, five years of experience. What kind of junior have five years of experience? I'm sorry, I didn't come out of my mom's programming.

Speaker A
Yeah. You have to have five years of Swift experience.

Speaker B
I'm sorry, I just can't wrap my mind. Sometimes I don't even apply. But now I apply and I will apply. There's a company, I don't want to say their name, but I keep applying and I keep getting different people to reject me now. So I'm like, maybe I'm onto something here.

Speaker A
Nice. So it sounds like you all just did a coding challenge and turned it in very recently. Can you tell us a little bit about what that experience was like?

Speaker B
The coding challenge was really a general, I would say challenge in terms that they want to recruit people that have a web development background and also mobile development.

Speaker A
True. Full stack. Full stack. Plus also all the iOS.

Speaker B
So basically you had to create a client and a server and retrieve some dummy JSON and do the functions and all that coming from an iOS bootcamp. We mainly learn iOS frameworks and not really doing server stuff, but we did learn how to learn and how to do research and how to spend your time researching and trying and whatnot. So they gave us like five days to complete it, and I spent five days studying from scratch how to do a server. And in iOS, I use Vapor, which is, I think, one year old or something. It's very new. Luckily there were some resources. If I don't get it, I haven't had a response yet. But if I don't get it, I just got to learn something new, something that I going to play around with now and maybe in the future say, hey, I cannot learn how to use this now. I learn a little bit of paper and server Swift and all that. So it's been a good experience. Let's see how it goes. But yeah, it's been challenging. From my experience, you usually don't get this kind of coding challenges for iOS.

Speaker A
Yeah, I've never seen you have to also build your own server. They'll give you, like, here's some JSON, like, make an app from the JSON. Yeah, I've never seen also make the server that needs to vet the JSON. Yeah, it's cool that you guys use Vapor, though. I still haven't had a chance to play with any of the server side.

Speaker B
I didn't know what to do, so I did my own research and land some tutorials, and that's where my understanding was better. So I just go, but it sounds.

Speaker A
Like you have to work.

Speaker B
That's pretty good.

Speaker A
You now know more about server sideswift than I do. I think that both of us combined. Did you do the same code challenge?

Speaker B
Yes, I did. Interestingly. The previous code challenge that I got, I had to interact with server and do a Get post put and delete request. And because I was, I guess going through the interview process, I was able to build this out.

Speaker A
Right.

Speaker B
So I was just like, okay, I know how to do the client aspect of it. It's just a server. How the hell I set up a server. I don't even know how to do this. So I had Saturday, and there were deadlines. They gave us a deadline of Monday, then Wednesday, and then Saturday today. Yeah, they push it several times. Yeah. So basically I found somebody and I was just like, hey, listen, I don't know how to do this. I've been struggling since Saturday. I spent all Saturday, Sunday, Monday. Can you please help me? So I set it up in Rails. I understand what's going on. And then I was able to fix something and then creating that client to interact with that server. It worked out. So I guess like co challenges in a way. This has been a hard journey just interviewing, but I've learned a lot. And so because of the previous code challenge, I was able to do this.

Speaker A
Got you. Okay. And so by code challenge, basically, this is like you're interviewing the company. They give you some code to take home and say, like, bring this back to us for complete basically.

Speaker B
Yeah. They had set up the server for me. I just had to interact with it.

Speaker A
Got you. And that was the first one. And then the second one that I just did was set up the server.

Speaker B
Yeah. So I set up the server, but I knew how to interact with it.

Speaker A
Right.

Speaker B
So it was not that bad this time, but the server was. We'll get back to you on that.

Speaker A
Yeah. So you turned that in very recently.

Speaker B
Yes.

Speaker A
How recently?

Speaker B
Five in the morning today. I was often just like, no, because the previous co challenge that I had received that I had gotten, I got rejected, obviously. Fun part. But he had given me a lot of feedback, so I tried to go ahead and apply that over. I was like, no, I'm not going to make the same mistakes. I'm going to go ahead. I just didn't use access specifiers, which I should look into using, but I think I got everything to work. Everything works, everything's great. And I sent it over.

Speaker A
Nice. Access specifiers being like public, private.

Speaker B
Public private.

Speaker A
Yeah. Okay.

Speaker B
I've never used them in Swift.

Speaker A
Yeah, that's a weird thing to ding someone on, I think, because the only.

Speaker B
Time I've used XS specifiers is C plus plus. But I remember you had your variables and then you had your methods that were public and then your properties or your variables were private, and then you manipulate them.

Speaker A
Right. Well, in Swift, it's okay to have public properties in a way that some job in C plus plus or C styles you're like, not really supposed to do. But the nice thing I think about Swift's access specified stuff is like it just kind of works if you don't do anything.

Speaker B
Yeah, exactly.

Speaker A
It's all internal, magical. Right. They are there like you can make stuff private, but I don't think that should be required. I don't see that seems weird unusual to look for an application.

Speaker B
Sometimes I wonder, with these coding challenges, if they really want to hire iOS.

Speaker A
Developers, what kind of people do you think they want to hire?

Speaker B
So these coding challenges, like setting up a server in iOS for a junior fellowship.

Speaker A
Fellowship being more like an internship. Three months.

Speaker B
Yeah, a few months. Not really a role. So makes me wonder, do you really want to help people or you just put in this challenge just to reject.

Speaker A
Someone and say, you tried?

Speaker B
Have that filter so thin that no junior almost can't get in.

Speaker A
Right?

Speaker B
Yeah, I've heard stories too, at particular companies. I won't name them, obviously, but they said, don't apply there. You're not going to get in. Just don't do it. Don't do it yourself because they're looking for somebody that's really, really good. I've had a senior level developer tell me, people are looking for unicorns. That's what they're looking for. And nobody can find a unicorn.

Speaker A
That's really what it is. The idea of being like this mythical tenant developer or whatever.

Speaker B
I'm sorry I don't have ten years of experience. I have like a year, but I'm willing to learn.

Speaker A
Interesting. Yeah. Are there any other interesting or weird or bad interview experiences that you want to go over? I think those are really enlightening to us, I think to our audience as well, what it can kind of feel like from the other side. Yeah.

Speaker B
I just recently when I interviewed with the company, because I thought it was more iOS fundamentals that I was going to be tested on, I didn't focus on algorithms as much because co challenges are more like build out an app. I haven't had that time.

Speaker A
Right.

Speaker B
So he asked me an algorithm question at the end. He said, oh, good luck with your job search. That was developer. And I thought, HR is supposed to do that in a nice way. Like, you're not a good fit for us. Good luck, I hope you find something. But the developer just told me, hey, I've got a meeting. I got to go, and good luck with your job search.

Speaker A
That's kind of like a rude thing to say. That seems very is it? I've noticed that some companies do like I've seen both. I've seen companies that really want to know, do you know how to make a Linked list? Or invert a tree or whatever, and they say, like, oh, the APIs don't matter. You can always look up the APIs. And then I've also seen the opposite as well, which is where they'll say, oh, we really care that you know what you're working with. Like, Linked list one or whatever. Those things you can look up. If you have performance problems, you'll deal with them as they come up. We really care that you know how to work with the thing that you want to work with, which this case would be like cocoa APIs and Swift details and stuff like that. So I've seen both and unfortunately, I don't think there's any way to know when you're going in, which one you're going to see, which is frustrating. Yeah, I'm sure that is right. There's really no way to know that ahead of time, like what sort of things you're going to be tested on that trips up.

Speaker B
I just want to add learning to read documentation API documentation is a skill in itself. It is really, truly.

Speaker A
One of the things that really struck me about talking to you, Sarah, was when we were talking about core data. And I remember when I was trying to figure out what core data was, I read the documentation multiple times and I was like, what does this mean? And it was really not until I tried to use it and make an app that I figured out what it meant. But you wrote a blog post detailing what core data is about, remembering this, right?

Speaker B
Yeah.

Speaker A
You wrote a blog post about what core data was all about, and it seems like you were able to understand it just from the documentation. And I was just so like, oh no.

Speaker B
Shocked? No, I read a whole bunch of blogs, basically at the beginning, at the end of Flatiron is a great school. It's a great, great school. It'll teach you how to learn and teach yourself and it's great. But two of the major topics, a network hall and core data, I had to spend I wanted to understand every line. I was like, okay, so if I do a get request, I have a URL, I'm converting the URL. I have to unwrap it now. I have to create the request, and then I have to create a task because what am I getting back? I wanted to understand every piece of that. And just you have to constantly go on a search. Like it's like looking for an egg on egg or whatever. I don't know. It's just crazy. You can't just read the documentation. You have to find other people that understand it better and then you'll understand it.

Speaker A
Right. Interesting. But we don't want to make you guys relive all these terrible things. But I don't know. I remember from talking to you all at the meetup that I was like, really? Because I feel like from the inside of the company, people are saying a lot like, we want more developers. We have a tremendous dearth of developers. We want women, we want people of color. We want to work on this, we want to work on this diversity problem that we have. And when push comes to shove, nothing happens. And so to meet two iOS developers that I talked to that clearly were smart, clearly knew what they were talking about, and to hear that they had such trouble was really. Eye opening for me. And I think some of these other things that even the stuff that we're hearing today also is very eye opening. So I do really do appreciate you sharing these stories with us. But yeah. Anything else? Anything craziness?

Speaker B
Yeah, I went to a big company that I've watched them ever since I was a kid. So when I got the opportunity, I was like, oh, my God, this is so great. I'm going to make this great. I went to the interview. There were three people, and the third person was he was on some video chat, whatever. He looked so bored. He slumped over. He was so bored. I was just, like, on the verge of saying, I'm so sorry I'm boring you.

Speaker A
Yeah, well, man.

Speaker B
And there was just, like, back to back questions. This, that, this. And I guess it was one of those programs where they take you on, they train you for four weeks and then they'll go ahead. Either they'll put you in the mobile development team back end or front end. And it was just like, okay, I know it's a boring subject, but don't look that bored.

Speaker A
Right? Don't fall asleep on me here.

Speaker B
Yeah, he was the merge, like, okay, come on, finish up with this.

Speaker A
Yeah. So maybe talking about interviews, like, as someone who interviews candidates at at work occasionally, and I Surush you end up doing the same occasionally too, I think. Yeah. What are some things that you two would like to see? Like, people in my position keep in mind that we might not think about.

Speaker B
Imagine yourself in our seat. Please understand that we're very nervous. It's a nerve wracking process. It's not like every other career, oh, I have a degree and I can do it. No, it's like, okay, you have a degree, let's see if you can do it. But just because we can't do it in that moment doesn't mean that we can't do it. We can do it. When I first learned core data and making a network call, I was just like, how am I going to search up this? How am I going to find my error? But now I understand. Just invest in us. Just give us that opportunity and we'll show you. We'll definitely show you. I think if people understand that it's what it's like to be on the other side and they should be a little more forgiving, please. And they give us an opportunity. We can do it. I know I can do it. I know, erica and we will make it. So I see many companies and people that want more diversity and are willing to give some help, but I think the biggest help is like, if you are part of a company, just open an internship role or something like that for someone junior. I went to a big company last December, and they want to help junior developers and diversity people to get into tech role, but they don't have an internship role or a junior role. I mean, that's the biggest way that you can make a difference. If you really want to help, just make that role happen. Open that position. It's not enough talking about it or having coffee meetings with junior developers. Just open a position and give an opportunity to someone that's looking to grow. Yeah. Don't just talk to talk.

Speaker A
Walk. Walk the yeah, coffee is really easy. Getting from a job is really hard.

Speaker B
I was very grateful for them to show me their company and have coffee meetings. But where's the apprenticeship role? Just make something open a position and try to fill that out. Yeah. Create a program where you have people, you take on people and you mentor them the right way and they're going to turn around and they're going to say, this company gave me an opportunity. I'm going to do whatever it is to make sure that code doesn't break. Right. It's a big company. I'm sure they have the resources. That company and many other ones definitely to at least have one junior role.

Speaker A
I know a lot of companies do. They do internships in the summer, I think because they want to get college kids before they like when they enter the market, it's going to be hard to get them. So if you can work with them before, you can kind of trick them into like, oh, I know this company and I'm going to go back to this company. So maybe this summer is where some of the internships are.

Speaker B
Yeah, it's looking better than at the end of last year. Because of that, there's more internship and.

Speaker A
Apprenticeship, but like year round internships. I mean, there's people who are looking for jobs all the time, not just in the summer. So yeah, that could definitely help too. And if the internship program is worth it for the company during summer, it's worth it for the company all year round. Right. Like it should be. Yeah. I know at work we have summer internship programs, but I don't know why we don't have internship programs just year round. Right. Or like one summer class and one winter class or whatever. Yeah. That's interesting. Yeah. Is that one of the most grueling interviews I was in? It's like five or 6 hours of just like coding and it was bring your laptop, plug it into the projector of the TV and code while we watch you. And one of the most stressful parts of it to me was really that you don't know who the other people across the street are. You assume they're pretty smart because they're like the ones who are in charge of interviewing. That may be true. It may not be true. But in this particular case, there was two of them and one of me. And it always felt like both of them knew the answer, and they were kind of ganging up on me. Even though that interview was just really stressful. Whether or not you get it or whether or not you feel comfortable or whatever, but just like the stress levels are just having two people watching you is just like, super intense. And I remember that being a feeling I was really not that into. And yeah, I think when possible, one on one interviews are a little bit chiller. They take a little bit longer because if you are the same number of people, you're going to need to have, but it's nice to have a little bit more, like, parity between the two parties.

Speaker B
Yeah. One of the interesting questions that I've asked a lot of people is how do you answer when you don't know the answer? And because it seems like developers are these genius people, I feel like I have to throw out a really bullshit answer. But I don't want to do that because I want that person to say, okay, I want to say, I don't know this, and I would love to go back and look into it now.

Speaker A
Right.

Speaker B
So it's just like I don't know what to say at times, and I get so nervous and it's like, what do I say? Do I tell them that I don't know? Is that going to hurt me?

Speaker A
At least for me, if I'm interviewing, if the answer is like, I don't know, but this is how I would go about finding it out, that's useful information, and I think I'll appreciate that much more than a bullshit answer. Right? Yeah. Two things I found. One is like, taking time to think about it. Sometimes you're like, this makes no sense. How could this even be a question they're asking me? And then if you spend a little time thinking about it, you can get to that place. So maybe take some time. Could be one piece of advice. And another piece of advice is or I don't know if this would be possible. Did that interview that I just mentioned, we had a laptop and we were coding, but it was totally free for all in terms of Googling. Yeah, you still need to know what to look for and how to look for that stuff, and you're still going to have to write the code and influence or whatever. I don't think they want to see you. They'd say you can't Google the question to the thing and just like, copy it, but you can Google, how do I do a regular expression objective C? Because who can remember that it was a free for all for Googling? So if there is a situation where look, I don't know this, you want to watch me Google and see how I might find the answer to this and see if that gives you a piece of information that you need when you're trying to make a decision about whether I'm going to be smart person who can grow here or not. Again. I think developers pretend they're smarter than they actually are.

Speaker B
That is the one thing I feel like they're really smart. Developers are really smart, but some of them are just not as approachable.

Speaker A
Yeah. And a lot of people just want to be right in the interview. They just want to ask a question that's super hard so they can tell you the answer.

Speaker B
Yeah, I would. And this guy just, like, my friend was asking a question, he just insulted her.

Speaker A
Wow.

Speaker B
And he was just like, oh, you would know it because you're I was just like, what?

Speaker A
Yikes.

Speaker B
And I just feel like you should technology is a very powerful technology is a great and powerful field, but you're not God, calm down. So I was just, like, blown away, and this is at a meetup. It's not even an interview or something, but, wow, you should do that.

Speaker A
At the end of every job interview. I feel like the question that we're always supposed to ask is, do you have any questions for me? Yeah. Which can be useful, but sometimes can also be, like, just kind of a formality room. But we really do want to know if there's other things that you want to know from people who would be sitting from the other side of the table, like a question about what do you do when you don't know the answer? Stuff like that. If there's anything you all want to.

Speaker B
Ask us, could we ask that? Could we say, hey, so how is it like being in my place? Can you tell me about your experiences?

Speaker A
Yeah, usually I think that there's two things that happen when the interviewer asks that question. One is they just want to be able to say, hey, I asked that person, do you have anything for me? And they kind of expect to hear, no. The other thing is, I've heard places that actually want you, they expect you to have a question for them, and the quality of the question is actually indicative of what kind of person it is. Yeah. I think when we ask that question at the end of our interviews, what we're kind of looking for is, are you interested in curious about our team, our product, maybe the processes that we follow? Are you curious about any specific frameworks or libraries that we might use? Do you have questions about the company in general? And there is no wrong answer, really, or wrong question, just, like, show some sort of interest in, like, the team that you're that you're trying to join?

Speaker B
I've had two developers, and I wanted to ask some more questions, but it was just like, oh, I have to go because I have a meeting, because I have a meeting. And there was one guy, he started the interview late, and he was like, I really got to go because I got to interview the next person. So I was just like, okay, but I wanted to ask him, how do you deal with because you have three people on the team, how do you deal with something that you don't know? What do you do? I want to be able to go ahead and figure that out for myself as well. But a lot of times it's time and sometimes they're just not interested, I think.

Speaker A
Yeah, it sounds like you've had interviewers and it sounds like the interview process is really not great. In general, I would keep asking that question. I think it's a good one. I've never considered myself, but that's a good one. One that I was asked, like a freebie is just like, so do you use Trello? What's the deal? What are your tools? Like use Jira, use this, use that, and kind of tools, I feel like, are a very nice common ground to kind of just catch up with someone and talk to them about how they think about stuff and kind of disarm everybody. So I like to ask that one. Yeah. So some other easy questions. I think, depending on how familiar you are at the company, like, how big is the team, how many developers are on it, do you have remote people on the team, stuff like that. What's your vacation policy?

Speaker B
Yes, I'm really interested in mobile development as a whole, and I want to do Android as well, and I hopefully we'll start next week doing that. But I just like to ask, how did they make sure that the Android app and the iOS and the app on iOS is the same? How does that work? That, to me, is amazing.

Speaker A
You think it works? Usually it's very hodgepodge together, cobbled together. It's not a great situation. Usually. I don't know if you all well, that varies based on the company. I could tell you about our product management, part of the organization, and how there actually is some strategy that goes on there. That's a really good question to ask.

Speaker B
Yeah, I've also asked if the iOS person will go ahead and work on the Android as well. And some companies like, no, we only have like ten people on iOS. That's it. They work on iOS only. And I'm like, oh, okay, cool. I also asked about diversity and the numbers of women and people of color in their teams and what are they doing to change the numbers, too, and how they see their companies in a few years from now and how they're trying to grow their mobile team like that.

Speaker A
Do you ever get any satisfying answers from that?

Speaker B
I feel like I get the same answer, like the nice answer. I would like to hear more action based answer.

Speaker A
Right. That's a shame. That is an interesting question to ask, though.

Speaker B
Yeah, but I just want to mainly get to see their reaction first, because you get your answer from that mainly and what they're thinking, at least.

Speaker A
If it's just pure horror on their face. They don't care too much or if.

Speaker B
At least they're thinking about it, because that's like the beginning.

Speaker A
Yeah. You got to start somewhere.

Speaker B
I interviewed for a dev shop. They're really cool. It was interesting. When I went out to the interview, they said, look, we only have one woman on the engineering team who was my classmate, right. And one of my friends, four of my friends had interviewed. Right. So two out of the four had gotten to the fourth stage. Right. They rejected the guy because they wanted a girl, but he made it to the fourth stage. So obviously they needed somebody. And then they interviewed me, like, five months after for the same position. And I just didn't understand, why did they reject him? Because I feel like a lot of times they know what they want, and if they don't want you regardless, they will not take you.

Speaker A
Right.

Speaker B
So I felt really bad because he was a guy, but they just wanted more women.

Speaker A
Right.

Speaker B
So if certain women didn't make the cut, they didn't even want the guys. So just give everybody an equal shot. Like, let their skills speak for themselves.

Speaker A
Don't do that. So at this point, we're a little bit longer than a normal episode of the podcast, but I think this has been a really interesting and eye opening conversation. Before we wrap up, I guess, any closing thoughts from you, Erica or Sarah?

Speaker B
Just give us a shot.

Speaker A
Please.

Speaker B
Just give us a shot. Yeah. Be willing to be more open to juniors. And if there's any junior developers listening to, just keep trying. Never give up and be positive and keep studying. It's going to come.

Speaker A
We had an email from someone, a very nice email that said they had been listening to our podcast and they just got their first full time development job. And I don't think there's a causal relationship there. I don't think they got the job because they were but it was a very nice email to get. And yes, there are people out there that are definitely, like, listening to our podcast, trying to get jobs, trying to figure out the industry. Yeah, keep trying. There's nothing else you really can do. You can just try to be clever, try to be smart.

Speaker B
Yeah. Some people that I've met, like Zurich, when I met you, I was just like, wow, there are people like that. Or Order at Artsy. I was just like, oh, my God, I love Order. Such an amazing person. Can I work for him forever? And, like, meeting you and Chris, it was just like, wow, these people are so nice. They're not like, geniuses who sit there and just code all day. They actually interact.

Speaker A
Yeah, we try to be nice, but we are in our flaws.

Speaker B
You guys are pretty awesome.

Speaker A
Thank you. On that note, I guess thank you, everybody, for listening and thank you so much to you two, Sarah and Erica, for joining us. Absolutely.

Speaker B
Thank you for having us.

Speaker A
Absolutely. And we'll talk to you all next week. Yes.
