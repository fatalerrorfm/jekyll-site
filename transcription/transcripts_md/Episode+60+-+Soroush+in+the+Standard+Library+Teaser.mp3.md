Speaker UNK
Weird.

Speaker A
Okay, so what it did is, because the tests themselves are written in swift, it broke something somewhere such that the tests couldn't actually complete, which is good in a sense. It means that I can effectively break these tests, right? Like, you want to know that there are tests covering the thing, that you might change it to my implementation. And then no tests failed.
