Speaker A
Yeah. I didn't start this podcast to talk about to talk about iPhones. To talk about new iPhones. I feel like other people have that well covered. It's fine.

Speaker B
I mostly just want to bitch that like the one thing that I care about the one thing that I care about getting thinner is the watch. And they made it thicker.

Speaker A
You wear the watch regularly?

Speaker B
No, I don't even own one anymore because it's too thick.

Speaker A
Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker B
It looks absurd.

Speaker A
Yeah, I agree with that.

Speaker B
Every time they come out with new hardware, I check and see if it's gotten less absurd and it got more absurd. This iteration, I can't do it.

Speaker A
Yeah. I can't wear it because it's not round.

Speaker B
Yeah. It looks so weird.

Speaker A
I reject it. I just reject it.

Speaker B
I own some number of watches. They're all round. They all look nice. They're all not like 1.6 CM thick.

Speaker A
That's right.

Speaker B
Or whatever the hell the new watch is. And that's how I like things.

Speaker A
Yeah.

Speaker B
Are you going to get the iPhone X?

Speaker A
The iPhone definitely get an iPhone X.

Speaker B
Okay. And talking about naming okay. The OS Ten name worked so well, and everyone knew how to pronounce it OS Ten instead of OSX.

Speaker A
Yeah, but everybody says OSX, even though.

Speaker B
It'S wrong that they renamed the operating system move away from it. And now they're using I was reading the Arch technica roundup and it was like the iPhone X pronounced Ten. Oh, my God. I thought we were done.

Speaker A
So my feeling on this is if it's a path towards getting the numbering system to line up with the years right. Because remember the iPhone came out and earlier I find the iPhone.

Speaker B
Sure.

Speaker A
But then it was the it was like, well, people thought it was the third iPhone, but it was really the second iPhone. And then the three GS came out. We're like, okay, they're going to normalize the numbering system. Then four came out was great. And then they did four S and it's like, well, four S. This is the fifth iPhone. Why is it called four S?

Speaker B
No, I don't disagree, but don't we know at this point that the X pronounced Ten thing just doesn't work?

Speaker A
Yeah, I mean, I guess we do.

Speaker B
I mean, I'm not a marketing person.

Speaker A
But I'm not a genius, but I.

Speaker B
Just feel like no Johnny eyes.

Speaker A
It's stupid. But if they just make next year's iPhone, be one iPhone and call the iPhone Eleven, then everything's totally square.

Speaker B
But still keep selling, like previous four years of iPhones, apparently, right?

Speaker A
Yeah. There's never an iPhone nine.

Speaker B
Are you going to get the iPhone X?

Speaker A
Absolutely. There's one feature that I want, and I'm going to get it for that one feature.

Speaker B
Well, let me say so I wasn't planning to, because I was like, it's not worth the extra money for Face unlock and the display and everything I'm fine with, but I really want the dual camera thing in a phone that's not the iPhone plus size.

Speaker A
Oh, sure.

Speaker B
And the iPhone X, they apparently got the dual camera thing in a phone that's more or less the same size as the iPhone Six S that I'm currently using.

Speaker A
Yeah, and they're both stabilized, which I don't think was true. It's not true, the telephoto on the iPhone seven. It might be true, the telephoto on.

Speaker B
The eight, but yeah, I've always wanted this, but I'm not willing to carry a phone that big. But the iPhone X, like, fits us all in a thing that I'm willing to carry. So I'm going to spend absurd amount of money on a phone.

Speaker A
Seems good. Yeah, I honestly think it's fine. I don't think it's a big deal. Well, I guess I could always say I need one for my work.

Speaker B
I don't have that excuse.

Speaker A
You don't have that excuse anymore? You got to get a startup job, man.

Speaker B
Yeah, it's fine.

Speaker A
So the one feature that I want that literally, they can take away all the other features. And this one feature would make the phone worth it is the animoji. Animoji are so fucking cool and they look awesome.

Speaker B
Really?

Speaker A
Yes, absolutely.

Speaker B
You think people are actually going to use this?

Speaker A
I think you're going to see so many fucking animoji, it's going to be fucking crazy. It's going to be a new source of memes. It's going to be really cute to send to your significant other. It's going to be I want to caveat this with the fact that I saw the Apple Watch and they had those really freaky, like, the thumbs up glove and the laughing face in three D. And those I thought were really gimmicky. I thought the digital touch was gimmicky.

Speaker B
But you think this is different?

Speaker A
I think this is absolutely not gimmicky. I think this is fucking cool. It's really cute. People are going to go crazy for this.

Speaker B
I think this is my take, was I looked at this and rolled my eyes. I was like, this is digital touch. This is the Apple Watch full screen animated emoji thing, basically.

Speaker A
I think the only problem with it is there's not enough animals and shit. Also, like, there's furries out there. They're loving it.

Speaker B
No, I looked at this and my thought was, like, this is just another gimmick to justify the effort they put into AR.

Speaker A
Wow. There's a tech rich article called Animoji Are Dumb and I detest them.

Speaker B
Okay, well, that's a strong take. I'm not going to say to test them. If it makes you happy, go for it. I just think that it's not going to be really widely used.

Speaker A
I don't know if it's going to be widely used. I won't go that far. But I think it has so much promise and it has so much like I'm telling you, there's going to be memes about this already.

Speaker B
Remember imessage apps?

Speaker A
Yeah, but I don't know, I was never really convinced that those had that much promise.

Speaker B
I'm not convinced.

Speaker A
They're really funny. They're really cute. It's like a Snapchat filter, but through a different avenue. People love snapchat filters. They love looking like dogs and shit.

Speaker B
Yeah, people love Snapchat filters. People don't love as much Instagram filters, which remember Instagram has every Snapchat feature. Like somehow people are still using Snapchat. You can send fun things through imessage. Nobody uses that.

Speaker A
Nobody uses stickers. This is better than stickers. It's better than not even stickers.

Speaker B
Full apps. Remember how apps were going to be the big thing for imessage?

Speaker A
Well, I have feelings on that too, which is that the imessage apps don't give you enough access to the things to be able to make useful stuff. You can't figure out who's in the chat. You're not allowed to know who's actually in the chat. So that really limits a lot of stuff you can do. I understand security reasons, blah blah blah. But there's a lot of things you can't do with imessage apps, so they're just not that valuable.

Speaker B
Yes. Also, the UI for it is totally undiscoverable and borderline unusable.

Speaker A
Yeah, it's still shitty in iOS eleven, but Animoji are so cool. They look great. I'm going to send a million of them to my cousins, to my girlfriends. They're really fucking. They're funny.

Speaker B
I hope you're right. I hope to be proven wrong. I'm just like the Apple doesn't have a great track record on things like this recently.

Speaker A
That's true. I would say that they have some things that are like sleeper smash hits. Like Imessage is the social network and it's like maybe the best one.

Speaker B
That's a bold move, a bold claim.

Speaker A
It really is, but I stand by it.

Speaker B
What do you mean best one? They replaced SMS on a bunch of people's phones.

Speaker A
Yeah, but okay, so the reason that imessage is the best social network is that people are on it. It doesn't have any cost. Being on Facebook has a cost where you essentially get advertised to you get whatever. Being on Twitter has a cost in terms of your sanity.

Speaker B
Being on imessage has a cost that you bought a multi thousand dollar Apple device.

Speaker A
And that's true. And I live in a particular bubble where I have literally two friends that don't have iPhones of maybe like 40 or 50 people that I text.

Speaker B
Imessage has like a much more perceptible, much more direct cost.

Speaker A
Yeah, I mean, I guess maybe what I'm saying is the cost I'm willing to pay, and it's a cost that everyone in my class basically is willing to pay.

Speaker B
Yeah.

Speaker A
Who do you know that doesn't have an iPhone?

Speaker B
I know. Let's go to messages.

Speaker A
Do it. Who are Green Bubbles?

Speaker B
Okay, green Bubbles, the woman who lives in the apartment downstairs for me.

Speaker A
Sure.

Speaker B
Someone one of my friends who I go biking with my dad now. One of my friends who works at a startup here in Ann Arbor who uses Android don't totally understand because he works at a security startup. But you do. You clicking through another friend who works at that same startup, different software developer friend. Like there are a lot of people who someone who matches on Tinder who stopped asking me. I think Imessage people are maybe in the majority of the last three weeks of Imessages or of text messaging that I've done here, but it's not a super strong majority.

Speaker A
Mine is like an overwhelming smashing majority. It's like one ex coworker sorry, three people? Two ex coworkers and one friend.

Speaker B
I don't know. Get more diverse friends.

Speaker A
Yeah, I guess so.

Speaker B
No, and I don't disagree. Clearly it's super, especially looking as a user base. It's like incredibly successful. But I think they really have not done well at adding features. On top of that, I don't remember the last time I got an Imessage with lasers effect attached.

Speaker A
I get them now and again. It's pretty rare, I would say. Yeah, most of the Imessage stuff they added was pretty much bunk. The previews for links are not bad. The delivery and red receipts are good. Pictures are obviously good. Videos are obviously good. Gifts are obviously good. Other than that, that's pretty much it. I think basically everything they announced last year or whatever it was for all the Imessage stuff was totally useless and.

Speaker B
I don't know, two years ago. Haven't Imessed out been around for two years now?

Speaker A
Maybe. Oh, building and find my friends and Imessage is really good.

Speaker B
Okay. That is cool.

Speaker A
I'll give you that one. Yeah, that one really useful. Yeah, it's good shit. And I don't know, I think these basically come down exactly to the animoji. They come down to execution. And I think, like, if you had made these less sorry.

Speaker B
You know what I think it comes down to? Not even necessarily execution, I think comes down to discoverability yeah, that might be right. Well, although people know how to use Snapchat somehow.

Speaker A
That's also true. Get off my well. And the other weird thing is going to be my girlfriend has an iPhone six. I'm going to send her a shitload of these and she's not going to be able to send them back well.

Speaker B
And also her experience will be like she'll get a message and then on the bottom it'll be like sent with an emoji. Imagine the face moving left and then right, and then the mouth opening.

Speaker A
I assume it comes through as like a video, but yeah. Good God. It could be really bad.

Speaker B
Oh, I know. One of the reasons that I don't send those things from my phone is like, I don't know what version of iOS, whoever I'm texting is running. They're just going to get like, my mom's going to get a text from me and then a text that says sent with laser.

Speaker A
Well, none of that shit works on a mac either.

Speaker B
Oh, yeah. I mean, it's like come like you have come on. I have a message on my up to date mac, ostensibly, and right now, if you send me something sent with balloons what does that even mean?

Speaker A
Worthless. Let me ask my 22 year old sister, who's big into Snapchat, what she thinks about animoji.

Speaker B
I mean, does she know what they are yet?

Speaker A
I'm going to tell her if she needs to know.

Speaker B
Okay.

Speaker A
What do you think about the new animoji thing from Apple? She didn't think that Snapchat spectacles were cool.

Speaker B
Did anyone?

Speaker A
I have a pair. All right. It's fine. They sold 40,000 of them. That's how many they sold, for whatever that's worth.

Speaker B
That's not a lot.

Speaker A
Not a lot?

Speaker B
That's like, half the tech workers in San Francisco. Not even what's the population of San Francisco?

Speaker A
The population of San Francisco is about 852,000.

Speaker B
Okay. Yeah, they sold that to, like, a somewhat small percentage of the people who live in San Francisco.

Speaker A
Well, they never really sold it in San Francisco, either. They only sold it in New York and La.

Speaker B
Okay, well, that's an even smaller percentage.

Speaker A
Let's see what they're can you still buy them online? I have an outstanding bet from last fall with Joe Fabisvich and Josh Avant that you wouldn't be able to buy spectacles in one year's time, and that is coming soon. And I'm really curious because you can buy them online right now, but I'm.

Speaker B
Really how much are they? Maybe I should buy them.

Speaker A
They're 129.

Speaker B
I'm not doing that.

Speaker A
I wouldn't do it.

Speaker B
I have better ways to spend $129.

Speaker A
That's right. Put them towards this phone.

Speaker B
Like replacing all the so last week on the ride, the same ride that I got back from just before we recorded, I lost my saddle pack with my multi tool and tire levers and patch kit, and everything fell off my bike, so I have to replace that. It's not quite $129. The time you add everything up.

Speaker A
I want to know what you think about the animoji. Does it look cool or lame? Live texting my sister on this episode of Fatal Error. It's fine. Everything's fine.

Speaker B
Welcome to this riveting Fatal Error bonus content. We've got all of our Apple hot takes. We might beat ATP with these hot takes to press.

Speaker A
She says, Will it work on all phones? You can see them on all phones, but you can only make them on the new one.

Speaker B
Hashtag not all phones.

Speaker A
Hashtag not all phones don't have me. Oh, wow. She goes, to be honest, I think it's a bit extra. Like, it won't be used like emojis. It'll be, like the effects thing. People forget it exists. All right. My sister's a young person. She knows better than I do.

Speaker B
I agree with your 22 year old sister. Yeah, no, I guess I'm not a young person anymore.

Speaker A
No, you're 30, man. You're, like, 35 now, right? Don't you have a mortgage?

Speaker B
None of the things you just said are true.

Speaker A
My only other feeling on the announcement today is the new Apple Watch seems really good. The fact that as LTE actually gives it a purpose, which is that I can just leave the house without taking my phone.

Speaker B
Yeah, don't get me wrong. It's so ugly. Right? I like that. I think it needs to be thinner, not thicker. And it needs to be round.

Speaker A
It's got to be round.

Speaker B
And I get that battery technology probably has to improve to actually make that happen, but that's what needs to happen.

Speaker A
What if in ten years, they made the Apple Watch x sorry, the Apple Watch. Ten?

Speaker B
Yeah. Just remember that it's pronounced it was round.

Speaker A
Seems good.

Speaker B
Ten years. I mean, is it round and is it not like a foot thick?

Speaker A
Yeah, the thickness doesn't bother me. Part of it is a gender thing. Men's watches are pretty thick, so I have one watch that's about as thick, maybe a little thicker than this. I don't love that it's thick. I prefer it was less thick, but it is what it is.

Speaker B
I think watches that I tend to wear are, like they're not necessarily thin, but they're not like I don't really, like, wearing really big, bulky, giant metal I don't know. I don't even know what they're called. Like, giant metal watches with, like, heavy duty metal bands. And that's too much for me.

Speaker A
Heavy duty metal bands? Yeah. Don't subtweet me. We got practice on Friday. Yeah. I also can't wear heavy duty metal bands because I have arm hair that gets ripped out and it's really excruciating.

Speaker B
Well, on that note, the last thing.

Speaker A
I want to say on the animoji is the selection is good. Monkey, robot, cat, dog, alien, fox, poop, pig, panda, rabbit, chicken, unicorn.

Speaker B
The cute animals are the only ones of those that anyone will ever use.

Speaker A
I think maybe the robot one will get a little usage. I think nobody will use the unicorn. I think nobody uses the alien. I think the animals will get a ton of usage. Imagine a cop doing something really bad or saying something really stupid, like, who is that cop that's like, oh, you know, honey, like, lady, you don't have anything to worry about. We only shoot black people.

Speaker B
Oh, my God, this fucking country.

Speaker A
Yeah, it's the worst. But, like, imagine that happens, and then somebody in their imessage thread, like, makes a video of a pig saying that and then posts. It'd be fucking hilarious. It's going to be amazing.

Speaker B
I don't even know how to respond to that. That's just like the oh, that's peak America.

Speaker A
I think the, like, scrolling through the emoji list. I think an octopus would be really cute. I think the baby chick would be really cute.

Speaker B
It sounds adorable.

Speaker A
The tiger and the lion are obvious. Gimme's the mouse is obvious. You can't do the frog because that's like, Internet racists. You can't do that.

Speaker B
Oh, my God, I hate 2017.

Speaker A
2017 has such a mouth feel to it. You know what I mean?

Speaker B
Remember when we all thought 2016 was bad?

Speaker A
Yeah. 2017 is like a hold my beer kind of level. It's like they were on stage talking, and they were like, oh, the Apple retail stores are now the new town square for every city. And it's like, you can't just replace a public institution like a town square or like a library with a place designed to sell you, like, computer phones and pretend the same thing.

Speaker B
And it's like capitalism.

Speaker A
That shit is very 2017. It's very on brand for 2017.

Speaker B
Hold my beer. Dan it's 2017. Hold my beer. I'm going to like this porn tweet.

Speaker A
This is a very topical we don't usually do very topical, so this is a good one.

Speaker B
You were going to have to get this out, like, tomorrow, or this makes no sense.

Speaker A
Definitely. There's a couple more. I think the Dragonface would be really good. I think the sun and the moon would be really good.

Speaker B
You're going to have to tap on your phone twice and force press this one corner of the screen, swipe past the balloons, which no one knows about to do this.

Speaker A
Yeah, it looks like it's an imessage app, which is, like, kind of lame.

Speaker B
I forget how you even I guess there's a button for these imessage apps, right?

Speaker A
Yes. So now in iOS eleven, there's a band across the bottom that gets covered by the keyboard.

Speaker B
Okay. So since I'm not an iOS developer anymore, right now, professionally, I have not run iOS eleven on any of my devices. It's actually very relaxing. Okay. So I'm looking at my imessage conversation with you. I have a fingers on a Heart button, which I'm not totally sure what that does. Maybe I can send you lips, I guess. Oh, there's a whole I can draw. Okay. So this is like the thing on the watch that nobody uses but on the phone. And I can tap on the little App Store icon.

Speaker A
You can also rotate the phone stickers.

Speaker B
No one rotates their phone.

Speaker A
It's horrible. The whole screen turns into a signing pad for the Square app or whatever. Then you go, like, sign your neighbor.

Speaker B
And send that shit accidentally sometimes.

Speaker A
Yeah, it sucks.

Speaker B
I literally only do this accidentally.

Speaker A
Yeah. So my sister says she thinks it's a bit extra and won't be used, like lasers and balloons and shit.

Speaker B
Yeah, no, I think she's right. Okay, so I can send you what apps do.

Speaker A
I even thinking of you. Oh, Chris. You were thinking of me? That's so sweet. I'm going to tap Keep on this. Can I tap? Keep on this.

Speaker B
I can send you music from the Broken music app that I don't use anymore, which, to be clear, is the music app that comes on the iPhone.

Speaker A
I have square cash. Genius. Castro.

Speaker B
I have square cash. Venmo, I can do two things here. I can send you cash or I can send you stickers, apparently.

Speaker A
Yeah, the stickers are really stupid. They need some young people is all I'm saying. Like, why is there not a Yelp? Other is a yelp. How do I do that? So open it. Share recently viewed loading. I'm thinking I'm loading. So my sister now says that she's revised her opinion on Spectacles and she now thinks they're cool and that I should buy. I got really snookered here.

Speaker B
Start up that credit card. Okay. So I tapped on Music, and I can share recently played items with you via Imessage. I'm going to read you these six things that I can send you. This is a tenuous definition of recently played Black Like Me by Spoon. Don't know when I played that. No Pride by Green Day back and forth by Foo Fighters. That's going to be the best song in this list. Percy's Bath, which apparently is from the Pocahontas soundtrack.

Speaker A
That's a little weird.

Speaker B
Don't know when I listen to that, but sure. Meet me. Something by Black Eyed Peas. Halfway, maybe, and some sort of ellipsis from AW nation. Those last two were cut up by ellipses because, like, why?

Speaker A
Some sort of ellipsis. I thought the name of the song was Some Sort of Ellipsis.

Speaker B
Some sort of ellipsis. Also, I don't think this entire UI does dynamic type.

Speaker A
That's really funny.

Speaker B
Doesn't matter because no one uses.

Speaker A
Yeah, so those are hot takes on Apple. Apple content.

Speaker B
Yes, that's the Apple event seems good.

Speaker A
I honestly could take or leave all the iPhone X stuff, but I'll be.

Speaker B
Spending $1,000 on it just because of the camera.

Speaker A
Because I'll be spending 1149 because you got to get that big phone.

Speaker B
No, 64 gigs is fine.

Speaker A
That's true. But it's a phone.

Speaker B
What are you like I have 13 gigs left on my current 64 gig phone.

Speaker A
Okay, that's good. I like to put all my music on there, and I like to put as many photos and stuff as possible.

Speaker B
Yeah, I do the icloud Photos thing with optimized storage. It works fine. And music is complicated for me.

Speaker A
Yeah.

Speaker B
The music app itunes Match is broken and doesn't work, and I don't understand how to use icloud music. And I'm pretty sure that it's broken and maybe it's broken, but itunes Match isn't. But somehow they're both trying to do things in my music library and I forget exactly what happened. But like a year ago, I canceled itunes Match in anger and haven't looked back. So now what I do is I have a Mac mini in my office here that runs Plex, and I have my music library on my MacBook. I have a job that r syncs it periodically to that Mac mini when I'm on the same network. And then I have the Plex app on my phone and I use a Plex app to stream my music collection and to download bits of my music collection that I want to be on my phone. And it works. And that's not how iPhones should work, but I'm sorry.

Speaker A
DJ, run that back. You are sync your music to your Mac mini so that you can play it on Plex.

Speaker B
Don't at me.

Speaker A
You really have become a system.

Speaker B
Oh, I did this a year ago. I did this well before my current job.

Speaker A
Oh, my God, that sounds horrible.

Speaker B
Because I have my canonical, like, itunes library. Of course.

Speaker A
Got to have the canonical itunes.

Speaker B
And then there's a launch D job that r syncs all the music every hour as long as I'm on my home network to the Mac mini. And that runs the, like, Plex server. It's fine. This is fine.

Speaker A
I'm glad I can use itunes Match. Let me just put it that way.

Speaker B
I forget what happened. I should go back through my old tweets and try to figure out what happened.

Speaker A
Yeah, I don't remember this. What's that? AI podcast. So, one quick thing. Can you come here for a SEC? So when I say the animoji thing, you said, oh my God, this is too much. And then you said, wow, with four W's. Does that mean it's good or bad? This is way too much. I'm a layman. I'm not like an Apple developer or an iOS developer. But I want to say that this is the first step to the inevitable AI taking over the world.

Speaker B
AI. Is not good enough to take over.

Speaker A
This is literally the beginning of a Dystopian fantasy. I just want you to know that this is the beginning. Is sending cupid. They all start like this, with this little, little cheevy thing that's like looking and it makes noise. It mimics people AI. Have you ever seen AI? I've seen AI. You think that the AI is going to analyze our emotions from our facial pattern and take advantage of us by sending us cute barriers to get us to do stuff? This is just one more barrier that humans are putting in between one another to prevent themselves from having authentic interactions. And I believe that if we follow this trail of events to its inevitable conclusion, we're all going to end up like Wally. So if I send you this fox Wally, but the people in Wally, you know, the fat people ripped up to the thing and they've got their avatars. It literally is Mind blaster. So if I send you this fox avatar and I said some cute shit with it attached, what would you be like? I would immediately ask, what would the fox say? And if you didn't do that, it would have been a missed opportunity. You see what I'm saying, Chris? There's just so much potential for hilarious memes. Whatever. I'm going to send you a shitload of these. I don't like the alien ones. You'll be able to watch them, but you won't be able to send them unless we can get you an iPhone X, too. It's not an iPhone X. It's an iPhone ten wow out. Never mind. Maybe I imagine iPhone X. You're so cute. All right.
