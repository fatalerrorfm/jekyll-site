Speaker A
So just as follow up, I had a, like, story from last week now, totally non tech related, but very impostor impostor syndrome related, and I thought I would share that.

Speaker B
Yeah. Fired up. Let's go.

Speaker A
All right, so some friends and I were doing a long bike ride last Saturday, and, you know, ahead of this, I was having some pain with my right shoulder, and one of my friends recommended that I go see this, like, sports massage therapist that she really likes. And so I get to this place Thursday morning, and this is totally a new experience for me. There's, like, exercise equipment everywhere. There's, like, metal music playing in this place.

Speaker B
You went to a gym? That's called the gym.

Speaker A
It's a new experience for me. And I get there and I walk in. I'm just like, wow, I so do not belong here. Like, this is for people who are, like, athletes and do athletic things. And that's imposter syndrome again, right? I'm here because I'm preparing for this big athletic thing.

Speaker B
Don't you, like, dozens of miles a.

Speaker A
Weekend on a regular basis? Regular basis, yeah.

Speaker B
And so that's that kicking in, right?

Speaker A
Yeah, totally. I totally belong here. But this new thing and there's this music, and this guy is people wearing workout clothes.

Speaker B
Very intimidating.

Speaker A
Yeah. I don't know what the point here is. Just, like, impostor syndrome is a real thing and affects everybody. So you got this.

Speaker C
You're cool.

Speaker B
We talked to someone who even had imposter syndrome.
