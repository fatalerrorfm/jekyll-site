Okay.

Soroush Khanlou
It's just that you can pretty easily go from PNG to either PDF or Pin code or whatever, but you can't really easily go from I'm using Swift and I'm not using Swift.

Chris Dzombak
Absolutely. A note about PDFs. Don't PDFs end up being rendered out to PNG during the build process anyway?

Soroush Khanlou
I'm glad you asked. Yes, they do as of iOS ten and earlier, but as of iOS eleven and later, they now are actually shipped in the app bundle, and the rendering is done at Runtime.

Chris Dzombak
Oh, neat. Is this an iOS change that I just missed because I wasn't paying close attention to dubdub?

Soroush Khanlou
Yes.

Chris Dzombak
Cool. That's really good to hear. I assume that this app, especially given the areas where you're trying to deploy it, probably isn't targeting iOS eleven exclusively.

Soroush Khanlou
That's right. That's exactly right.

Chris Dzombak
So you're going to be looking at Paint Code or generally at Programmatic Drawing instead of PNGs?

Soroush Khanlou
Yes, exactly. Programmatic Drawing probably Paint Code, the designer I work with already, I showed him Paint Code and he went crazy. He was like, this is awesome. So he went and bought it already.
