Okay.

Speaker A
It's just that you can pretty easily go from PNG to either PDF or Pin code or whatever, but you can't really easily go from I'm using Swift and I'm not using Swift.

Speaker B
Absolutely. A note about PDFs. Don't PDFs end up being rendered out to PNG during the build process anyway?

Speaker A
I'm glad you asked. Yes, they do as of iOS ten and earlier, but as of iOS eleven and later, they now are actually shipped in the app bundle, and the rendering is done at Runtime.

Speaker B
Oh, neat. Is this an iOS change that I just missed because I wasn't paying close attention to dubdub?

Speaker A
Yes.

Speaker B
Cool. That's really good to hear. I assume that this app, especially given the areas where you're trying to deploy it, probably isn't targeting iOS eleven exclusively.

Speaker A
That's right. That's exactly right.

Speaker B
So you're going to be looking at Paint Code or generally at Programmatic Drawing instead of PNGs?

Speaker A
Yes, exactly. Programmatic Drawing probably Paint Code, the designer I work with already, I showed him Paint Code and he went crazy. He was like, this is awesome. So he went and bought it already.
