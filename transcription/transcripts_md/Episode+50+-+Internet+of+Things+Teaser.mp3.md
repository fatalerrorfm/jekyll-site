The way this works is you take out your normal light switch that you just flip on and off, and you can insert a computer. It works reliably all the time.

Speaker C
Thank you.

Speaker A
So much. And then you can replace it with a computer. And as we all know, computers are not as reliable. And the way it works is it's a button and you hit the button, the lights come on. You hit the button again, the lights go off.

Speaker C
Again. I need to wrap the air quotes around all of.

Speaker A
These things.

Speaker C
You quote, hit the button and the lights come on.

Speaker A
Unquote sometimes. I'm sure that works. Yeah. Basically, the dream here is in addition to being able to push the button to turn lights on and off, you can also connect to it from the Wimo app or other connected services in order to basically control the lights from places that aren't standing next to the light switch.

Speaker C
That actually works surprisingly well.

Speaker A
Yeah. So that's the sort of dream of what I want.
