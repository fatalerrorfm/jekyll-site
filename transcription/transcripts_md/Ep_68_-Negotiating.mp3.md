Soroush Khanlou
Hey, man. What's up?

Chris Dzombak
Not a whole lot. It's sunny out.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. Yeah. It was a nice day today.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, here too.

Soroush Khanlou
So this is episode 68.

Chris Dzombak
This is episode 68. This is probably our this is our final Patreon only episode of well, I.

Soroush Khanlou
Think maybe episode 70 will also be Patreon only, but it may be a very special episode. We're still figuring it out.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, we're not sure what we're doing yet. We have to talk about that after this recording.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, we do. But this is our last Patreon episode. Our last, for sure Patreon episode. We just want to thank all of you all. We've done it a million times. We'll do it again. You all are the best. Thank you for helping us make this podcast.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, as we've said before, we'll just hammer the point home that really, these last few seasons wouldn't have been possible without those of you who are supporting us on Patreon. It makes us possible for us to produce the podcast, and we really do appreciate that.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, for sure. Chris, you want to talk about negotiating for salaries today?

Chris Dzombak
Well, does anyone really want to talk about negotiating?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, it's a spicy topic. This is why we keep we keep spicy stuff in the in the Patreon only episodes.

Chris Dzombak
That's right. We thought that this week, the topic of negotiating, this whole process of getting a good job offer that you like and that the company that's hiring you likes, how does that work?

Soroush Khanlou
It's very hard. It's very hard. And it's very counterintuitive.

Chris Dzombak
I think it's hard. It's counterintuitive. And especially, I think, for people like me who maybe stereotypically Midwestern, it's, like, very uncomfortable. Right.

Soroush Khanlou
A little too nice to negotiate your salary.

Chris Dzombak
Right. But it is necessary. And I mean, we'll cover this, but it's necessary. And the people on the other side of this negotiation are doing it, are treating it as a negotiation. And at the end of the day, it's business. It's a business negotiation. It's a business decision.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. So the first link in the show notes is what I consider basically to be the Holy Bible of software engineering negotiation. And I want to read a short little snippet of it, which I think is kind of the slam dunk best part. The thing is about 7000 words. So it's long.

Chris Dzombak
It's a long article, but it's well worth the read. In fact, maybe just go read that and don't listen to the maybe we.

Soroush Khanlou
Should just read this post out loud, and then that could be the whole show.

Chris Dzombak
Okay. We'll just trade off paragraphs.

Soroush Khanlou
But there's one particular part where I do want to read, which I think is really enlightening to just average people like you and me and our listeners. So the writer is Patrick McKenzie, and he writes, we've been talking about your employer as an abstraction, but in the instant case you're talking to an actual person. Let's call him Bob. It is bob's job to get you to sign with the company as cheaply as possible. But Bob is not super motivated to do so because and this part's important bob is not spending Bob's money to hire you. Bob is spending Bob's budget. Bob generally does not get a large performance incentive for shaving money off of his hiring budget. You get a new MacBook Pro if you convince Bob to give you five K extra. But Bob gets, if he is anomalously lucky, a dinner at TGI Fridays if he convinces you to take five K less. In fact, there are many organizations and Bobs, for whom power, status, and money come from asking for more budget every year. If you turn out to be on the expensive side, that's great for Bob, because he manages a high powered peon, so he must be a high powered manager. And this will help Bob get more budget next quarter. So if you're worried about what Bob will think of your moral character or you want to compensate Bob because you feel you owe him for this job opportunity, do Bob a solid and negotiate in a spirited fashion with him. So the important part here is, like, if I am trying to get Chris to pay for something, every cent I get out of Chris for something that I want let's say I want to make lunch for him, every cent that I get out of Chris comes out of Chris's pocket. But when you're negotiating for your job, when you're talking to that hiring manager or the HR person or whoever you're talking to, that money doesn't come out of their pocket. It comes out of somewhere else. It comes out of the business. The business is ready to spend a ton of money on you. And so I think this is the first kind of counterintuitive point of, like, you think that you're doing someone a favor by taking less money, and they don't care. It's not their money. It's not real numbers to them. They just don't care.

Chris Dzombak
Right? Like, worst case, they just don't care.

Soroush Khanlou
They actually like it like Patrick Benches actually like that you took less money or took more money.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. I think this kind of lines up with one with a similar thought, a similar point that is also made in this article, that employees are expensive. Like, the extra $5,000 that you may negotiate from Bob is, like, a very small percentage of your cost to the company.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. Your total cost includes the payroll taxes they have to pay on you, the healthcare costs they have to pay on you, all the overhead of putting you in an office and paying for your air conditioner and your computer and all that. And so an extra five K seems like a lot to you, but to the company, it's not as much as.

Chris Dzombak
You might it's such a small marginal cost. Right. So one thing that I am curious to ask you about this probably changes a little bit if you're at a startup, right?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. So if you're at a startup, things change. And I like to think of it as you have a bunch of dials to turn and so obviously one of the dials is your base salary, one of the dials is your signing bonus. So if you want a certain amount of money up front right, when you take the job, another dial is how many vacation days you have. Another dial is other benefits, like commuter benefits or something like that. Another dial is there's all these things that you can twist and turn to get from your employer. One of the main ones with startups is the equity that you get. And so part of what they say when you're negotiating with startups is say, okay, well, I will take a smaller salary because I know you just don't have the money to pay me as much as I would expect from right.

Chris Dzombak
This is like the one case where what we said before the company has money to spend on employees is not necessarily as true.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, it's not as true, but it is still true to some degree still true. If you're a startup and you raise your seed round of 500 grand, I would guess 90% of that goes towards payroll. That is what they're there to spend money on. They are not spending money on computers. The thing they're spending money on is people to build their cool thing. They're not spending money on other stuff. Whereas if you started a shaving company, you might have to buy a factory. Startups don't really work like that. So the main thing they have to spend money on is their employee salaries. And so that is like they're ready to spend money on that. They know they'll need to. That's what they raise money for.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. All right, I guess. Yeah, that's true. That makes sense.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. And I actually think that it kind of makes our lives a little bit difficult when they say, oh, you have unlimited vacation, you have unlimited sick days, we're going to pay for all your lunch.

Chris Dzombak
Because it actually mean, well, sometimes it.

Soroush Khanlou
Really does mean unlimited. Sometimes it means like we there's like.

Chris Dzombak
This, I mean there's often like a weird culture or not a weird culture, but like some sort of expectation that you'll take two weeks off in the summer and that's basically it, right.

Soroush Khanlou
The fact they give you unlimited. You're supposed to kind of take your cues from the other people around you and feel too guilty to take vacation. And that can be the case in some places, although some places really do mean you have infinite vacation. I've heard of people taking six weeks of vacation in a year, which sounds pretty good.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, I could deal with that.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, I don't know how far you can push that. If you had a sick family member, like how long they would let you go back home and take care of that family member. But when you have unlimited vacation time already on the table, there's no way you can tweak that as a dial, so there's no way that can go up. Whereas if they say, oh, you have three weeks of vacation, you could say, well, I'll take 2000 less this in my base salary, but I'll ask for three extra vacation days or something and we can't really do that so much in Starbucks, which is kind of a bummer. So you have fewer things to tweak. I primarily think of it as you have your signing bonus to tweak, you have your base salary and you have your equity.

Chris Dzombak
Okay, that makes sense. Yeah.

Soroush Khanlou
And startups, I think, are most ready to spend money on equity because it's fake to them. If they become successful, they'll be happy to pay you out and if they don't become successful, they don't owe you anything. And then they're next ready to, I think, pay signing bonuses because that's only for the first year. And then the last thing they want to budget on is sort of the salary.

Chris Dzombak
Right.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. So negotiating with startups can be a little bit different, but ultimately it's the same. You provide a big value to the company that you work for and your job is to get as much of that value back in your pocket as possible. One thing I went for fact that I really like is if you're, let's say, trying to value your startup or you're trying to sell your startup, one really good back of the envelope calculation is a million dollars per engineer. So if your startup has ten engineers, it's back of the envelope worth $10 million.

Chris Dzombak
Right. Just in terms of like a really rough estimate of valuation and it actually.

Soroush Khanlou
Happens to be more accurate than you would think.

Chris Dzombak
Really?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. It ends up being like close to the, close to the value. It's definitely within order of magnitude. And so if you're providing a million dollars of value to this company, how much of that value should end up in your pocket is the question.

Chris Dzombak
Right. Obviously not all of it's going to end up in your pocket because that's not how companies work. But an extra few thousand dollars really, I guess, again, is a pretty small amount of your value to the company.

Soroush Khanlou
Exactly, yeah, totally. Negotiation, I think. I think kind of what we're settling on is negotiation is this weird counterintuitive thing. It's sometimes hard to think about, but is still valuable to do. So because your salary ends up compounding over time, you usually don't take jobs where you make less than the job you had before. And so if you can negotiate an extra $5,000 on your salary, you may actually get to keep that for your whole career. And that is actually really valuable. So it's a super valuable thing to be able to do and it doesn't work the way you think it does. So it's worth learning a little bit about it so that you can get that extra scratch.

Chris Dzombak
In what other ways does it not work the way I think it does so far? I feel like it pretty much works the way I think it does. Except that things just are not as big a deal to the other to the potential employer as they are to you, the potential employee.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. So once you've read this post a couple of times then you kind of know some of the more counterintuitive things. But I still find people who fall into the trap of thinking that like, oh, if I ask for 5000 more dollars here I'm going to be taking out of the pocket of this person like it's a zero sum game. So I still see people that make that mistake. There's other ones as well. I think the main way to think about it is the things that are important to you may not be the things that are important to them. So one other example of a weird one is like the company is kind of incentivized. To give you the most ironclad confidentiality agreement they can. And it'll say you can't do any work on the side. You can't do any if you do anything on our computers, it belongs to us. And it's easy for them to ask for that. But at the end of the day that's not really enforceable and they really don't care if they get it or not. And so if it's something that's important to you, and you want to be able to make your own little side projects and not have to worry about the company that you're owning, the company that you work for, potentially getting a stake in that side project. When they give you that confidentiality agreement, you can say, hey, look, this is actually pretty important to me and I'm not going to sign this part of it. The lawyers call it redlining. You red line this price, I don't want to sign this part. Like go back and change this.

Chris Dzombak
Right? You may well be able to do that for right, at least parts of this agreement. And again, Bob doesn't really care, right?

Soroush Khanlou
Bob doesn't care at all. Fun little story. One time I joined a startup and kind of medium sized tens of employees and they gave me a confidentiality agreement and it said, anything you work on at any time belongs to us. And I said, hey look, I'm not.

Chris Dzombak
Really kind of crazy.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, well, and if you work for Apple or Google that's in there and you're not taking it out with these smaller startups, they just what are they going to do? And so I went back to them and said, hey, this contract is fine, but this part I can't work with this part, can you do something for me? And so I went back to their lawyer, and their lawyer changed it to anything you work on on the side. Just can't compete with us. And I was like, that's fine. I can work with that.

Chris Dzombak
I feel like that's a fairly standard employment agreement kind of clause.

Soroush Khanlou
Don't compete with us. Seems pretty reasonable.

Chris Dzombak
And it seems reasonable, right?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. And so they ended up changing it. I ended up signing it, and then later I heard that I was the first employee of all of their employees to send the contract back with anything to be changed.

Chris Dzombak
Really?

Soroush Khanlou
Every single person just signed it.

Chris Dzombak
That's kind of surprising, but not that surprising, right. I guess there's a tendency, especially before I read this article, to assume, okay, this is your standard appointment agreement. I take this or lead this. But again, all of this is malleable.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. Everybody who gives you a contract is going to tell you it's standard. It doesn't mean it is standard. The standard is what you signed.

Chris Dzombak
Right. Or even if it is standard, like, well, okay, we got this far in the process. Is this worth blowing up this deal over?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. That's another good counterintuitive thing, is the sort of sunk cost fallacy situation where once they've spent patrick talks about this in the blog post as well. It's a very good blog post. You all really should read it. But he says that if they have eight engineers interviewing you in groups of two for an hour each, let's say four interviews, two engineers each, that's eight, like, engineer hours of time that's worth thousands of dollars to the company already. And that's not including the phone screen. That's not including the time the HR person spent on you, the time they spent huddling up and talking about you to say, hey, should we hire this person or not?

Chris Dzombak
Right. By the time you get to the.

Soroush Khanlou
Point of salary negotiation, thousands of dollars on you. And so they really, really want you to sign. And so they've got this sun cost fallacy, and you can kind of take advantage of that sun cost fallacy that's going on with them and say, hey, I would love to sign. I would love to work for your company. Your company sounds great. I would love to provide value to you in X, Y, and Z ways, but first I'm going to need this.

Chris Dzombak
Right?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. And they spend all this time finding you, which is not easy. Yeah. If you know, for example, that their position has been open for six months, then that's something that you can bring up in negotiation. Hey, do you want to wait another six months to sign someone or do you want to sign someone today? Give me that extra four grand, and I will be happy to sign on the line that is dotted right.

Chris Dzombak
Oh, bell. I forgot we had those.

Soroush Khanlou
We got bells.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, we got bells. We're real podcast.

Soroush Khanlou
That's right.

Chris Dzombak
And that kind of one of the phrases they used there was like, take advantage of, which sounds like a bad thing. That doesn't sound like a nice phrase, right? And maybe it's not, but this is kind of something that I still haven't really internalized. This is still a hard process for me personally. But the thing to internalize, at the end of the day, it's business. You're like people dealing with each other, but it's a business deal. You can negotiate, you can ask for more, you can send a contract back and it will probably work. And I mean, if it doesn't work at the end of the day, that's nothing for you to feel bad about, right? It's purely a business. This.

Soroush Khanlou
So it's worth putting yourselves in their shoes, right. If they have an employee that comes in and says, hey, I want like ten grand more and then I'm happy to sign, they're not going to say, oh, this guy is so rude for asking for ten grand, we're just going to not hire him at all, right? People don't really work out because they're like, look, sorry we can't offer you ten grand more, but we would love to have you for this much. And if you can't sign it, you can't sign it, but this is what we got. Or maybe they can come up by five k. You ask for ten, they come back with five and you can decide if that's worth it. But they're not just going to kick you to the curb for asking for a little bit more money.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, absolutely.

Soroush Khanlou
For sure.

Chris Dzombak
One other thing to keep in mind is the standard negotiating advice that everyone tells you and that everyone tells you because it's true, is not to be the first person to name a number. This post has a couple of techniques for avoiding being the first person to name a number and hopefully you'll be able to avoid that. Another technique that I've used in the past is like to be the first person even number, but name a number that I think is completely crazy, take.

Soroush Khanlou
A number that you'd be happy to get, multiply it by an extra 20% and hit them with that.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. And if you get that, that's great because you're happy with it plus 20%. And if not, then you've named a point that they can't get to and then they're trying to negotiate you down from there.

Soroush Khanlou
Right, right, exactly. Yeah. Other stuff you can do, you can practice this stuff, take a friend and sort of, sort of role play the situation. Figure out the kind of the language that you use, saying that things are like, oh, that's a really interesting offer. I was thinking more in the ballpark of whatever. And then being able to have the language that these things are done in can be also helpful. So we're all playing that stuff can be good.

Chris Dzombak
That I think would have been good for me to do in the most recent situation like this that I was in. I think some of the conversations along the road just weren't I don't know, it didn't seem like they went super well. I think partly because I was kind of stumbling and struggling to find the words, and eventually it worked out. But we probably should have role played this before.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. A little practice never hurt anybody.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, definitely. Now that you mentioned that, I don't remember if this comes up in the blog post at all, but I mean, definitely practice. Like, how often do you actually practice this? Probably not very often. Maybe a few. Maybe what, ten times across your career? Something like that. On the order of magnitude ten anyway. Right? Yeah. Whereas whoever's on the other side here probably does this a lot.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. If they're a fast growing startup, they're doing this three times a week.

Chris Dzombak
Right. So yeah, I hadn't even thought about this before we started this discussion, but yeah, practice. You're at a disadvantage otherwise.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, for sure. I really hadn't considered that. They do this so much more than you.

Chris Dzombak
Right.

Soroush Khanlou
They do it a lot more than you. And you know what? I've done some of this stuff and sometimes it doesn't work, and sometimes you end up with an offer that you're not happy with. But again, at least you took a shot and you saw if it could work or not. And they give you an offer and you know that that's the best offer you're going to get from them. Whereas the other side of it is the side you don't want is like, you say, oh, I want 105,000, and they immediately say, Great, sounds good. Sign here. And you're like, well, maybe I screwed myself a little bit. And it depends a lot on the market that you're in. It depends on the competition of other engineers. It depends on how many employers there are. Obviously, New York and SF are going to be different than, say, Ann Arbor or other places like that.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. Elsewhere in the Midwest.

Soroush Khanlou
Elsewhere in the world.

Chris Dzombak
Right. There are other countries.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, that's right. It's tough, but you got to try. And if you try, you get more results than if you don't try. God, this is not helpful.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. I'm hoping people actually find the show helpful. One other note that I think also comes up in the article, but is to do research about the company, and this is standard just interview advice that a surprising number of people don't seem to do. I remember when I was interviewing developers for the Times, I think I can share this without sharing anything like confidential. I get a surprising number of candidates who had not used the New York Times iPhone app. It kind of feels like if you're interviewing to work on that app, you should at least have downloaded it and played with it for two minutes before the interview.

Soroush Khanlou
I have to be honest here, I am not great at this. Have gone into interviews without doing the research. I have gone into interviews without playing with the app, although I'm much better about that now. I try even with my clients before I talk to them, try to see what they've got and try to download it and play with it. Yeah, you are so much better off if you just know what their app does. And you can also hit them with stuff like, oh, I was going through this flow and I got a crash. And then hit him with like a joke, like, oh, if you give me get access, I would love to fix this for you.

Chris Dzombak
And that's great. And maybe on the flip side, the interviewer might say, so what kind of things might cause that crash? Is it just a crash with nothing particular going on? That's one thing, but yeah, then that can be a great conversation started during the interview, but right. Even setting aside during the interview process, which, again, if you've downloaded and play with the app, you're at an advantage over at least a third of the people see advantage over Sabre. But if you have people in your network who have worked with this company before, this obviously is more true, I think mid size or larger companies. And you're comfortable asking them about what do people value at this company? Is it titles, is it salaries, it vacation days? Is it equity? Is there anything that is easy to get the company to budge on? What's reasonable for me to expect from this company? Again, it's an asymmetrical game, right? So any information that you can get beforehand puts you at less of a disadvantage.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, totally. One other thing that I want to throw out is the upper bound is so inconceivably high. I just think about some of the numbers I've heard through the grapevine, and it's very high. Even just recently I heard on Twitter, Stephanie Hurlbert, I don't know if you follow her, but I don't know she's good. I'll put this tweet into the show notes, but she was saying, just a PSA. I know of many people, probably over 100, who are programmers who are making high six figures a year, including RSU, like stock options, bonuses, and she's like, that's just in my network. And when somebody asks her, what do you mean by high six figures? She means 500K plus. Damn, she knows 100 people making that. I'm not sure if I know anybody making that, but those people are out there. And the value that a programmer brings to the company is so, so big because you can automate processes, you can write code that pays for itself.

Chris Dzombak
You can write the product that the company is selling.

Soroush Khanlou
I mean, literally, you can make the product itself. But even you could do the meta work as well. If there's a challenging flow for gathering a certain kind of data. You can write a SQL query that will replace two data entry people. You could just do that in an afternoon and you just have a ton of value to the company. And like, Dan Liu, who's another great person, D-A-N-L-U he had a Tweet from a while back that he saved Microsoft, like, eight figures on their hosting infrastructure costs for Bing. He saved them somewhere between ten and $100 million. It's like, well, how much are you going to pay this guy? How can you pay this guy enough for what he's worth or what he saved you? And it's just so the top end is just so egregiously high.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. This is nuts.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, man. It's pretty unreal. I'll try to find that eight figures tweet as well. It's a crazy world out there. Maybe you're not going to hit these numbers. Maybe I'm not going to hit these numbers, or Chris won't hit these numbers. But you can push a little bit, and if you push a little bit, it can really make a meaningful difference in your life.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. You're probably worth more than you think you are.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, exactly.

Chris Dzombak
Maybe not to every company, but you want to find the companies where you are.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. And again, maybe you don't value having a ton of money. You do value some other kind of flexibility. And if you want to negotiate and say, I want more vacation time, or I want work from home days or whatever, you can make all that happen.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, absolutely.

Soroush Khanlou
Make all that happen.

Chris Dzombak
It may be maybe uncomfortable this, again, just come from my personal experience. Right. Maybe uncomfortable, but it's business. Right. None of this is really personally.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. Maybe we can close out with a cute little bit from the top of this post. Imagine something a wee bit outside your comfort zone. Nothing scandalous, just something you don't do very often, don't particularly enjoy, and is slightly more challenging than totally trivial. Maybe reciting poetry while simultaneously standing on 1ft. What if I told you I would pay $100,000 if you did five minutes of poetry recital while staying on 1ft? Would you do it? It's an absurd image. Or play it straight. There's no gotcha, no videotape, your friends will never see you, no YouTube. The offer is as simple as you think it is. Poetry, 1ft. $100,000. Would you read poetry for me? Of course you would. You'd be stupid not to.

Chris Dzombak
So what do you want me to read? Any favorite poetry?

Soroush Khanlou
And he says, what if you were talking about this at dinner with your friends? And one of them said, no, I'd never do that. I just don't do poetry. I'm an engineer. And beside, my father told me that people who stand on 1ft look silly. And what do I need $100,000 for anyhow? You would not clap them on the back and say, Damn straight, man. Poets always trying to tempt virtuous engineers into. Their weird poetry spouting, flamingo standing waves. You'd say, Dude, it's five minutes. I'll help you practice. And he says this is how he feels about negotiation. It is not a lot of effort. And you can get the $100,000 of value by maybe negotiating extra five grand and seeing those returns over ten or 20 years, which is really not unreasonable. I mean, you're going to be an engineer for a very long time, and that's money on the table.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. And it's something that I think engineers are stereotypically not great at. I certainly am not great at it and could use practice, but is very important.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, totally.

Chris Dzombak
And that's really all I've got. I don't know. I hope this was useful. You should read this blog post. You should yeah.

Soroush Khanlou
Frankly, just point to people as a blog post. The whole point of this whole point of this discussion, basically.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. Point. Some good observations. You should practice.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. You should practice. And you should study up on your company before you go in for an interview.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. Seriously. Download the app and play with it. Like you'll be ahead of 40% of people already.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah.

Chris Dzombak
It's mind blowing, but hey, Sirosh.

Soroush Khanlou
Hey, Chris.

Chris Dzombak
All right, on that note, I'll talk to you next week.

Soroush Khanlou
Cool. Talk to you later, Chris. Bye.
