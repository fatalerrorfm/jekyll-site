Soroush Khanlou
Hey, buddy.

Chris Dzombak
Hey, sir. How's it going?

Soroush Khanlou
Pretty good. I was distracted. What, by dynamic member lookup proposals.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. So this is something that I think we want to talk about. I'm actually like when I go back and reread this. There's a lot of words here. Don't think there's actually that much to really discuss, is there?

Soroush Khanlou
Pretty straightforward. I think it's Latinarianly. In depth latinarianly.

Chris Dzombak
It's not at all a word.

Soroush Khanlou
But you want to do a quick mini topic and then we can maybe talk about this proposal?

Chris Dzombak
Sure. So my mini topic here was this blog post from Marco almost a month ago. Now, actually, when this podcast comes out, it will be basically a month ago titled The End of the Conference Era. And this basically is about what the title implies. It's like he says he has a feeling last couple of years that the era of the small Apple ish developer ish conference is pretty much behind us. And I was curious to get your thoughts about this because I don't know, I haven't gone to too many of the small Apple developer conference things to begin with. Most of my conference experience in the Apple world has been with the WWDC, and that's definitely not a small conference by any means. But I mean, that said, I think I've mentioned to you before, even on the podcast, that I often find going to a conference, like, fun, but also really stressful. And I just don't want to go to too many of them because, I don't know, it's just kind of a lot on top of everything else. So I don't know. What are your thoughts about here? About this post?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, it's an interesting post to me because on the one hand, I know exactly what he's talking about. Yeah, it is extremely stressful to go to these conferences. Like you mentioned, it's expensive, which is the first thing he brings up. It is a really weird format where you just kind of sit in a room and listen to talks that you don't necessarily care about and you might get one or two that you think are just absolutely bonkers cool. It's just like a serious, intense thing. But on the other hand, there doesn't seem to be any dearth of these conferences. I spoke at Ten last year. Well, they weren't all iOS developer conferences, but I spoke at a lot last year and they weren't all sold out, but a lot of them were sold out and people were going to them. So it kind of does seem like you're kind of declaring the death of a thing that's like, that place isn't cool anymore. That place is too busy, nobody goes there anymore kind of situation. I see both sides of it. I see the side of like, well, it's been a while since I've really seen a conference that I was like, oh my God, I got to go to this. One example is friend and editor of the show, Joe Chaplinski, puts on release notes. And I went to that and paid to go to that. That was the last one that I paid to go to. Great conference, really cool venue. This was back when it was in Indianapolis. But at the same time they are still fun and cool ensemble. I don't think anybody's going to paying to go to four or five a year, but I think there may be still a market given that people are still putting them on and still working out.

Chris Dzombak
Are people still putting on small conferences or are they mostly bigger events? I think the only conference I went to last year was Strange Loop, which has gotten a lot bigger over the last over the past couple of years. This past year in 2017, it was split up between two venues for the first time. Partly because there's like so much demand. Right, right. Which is a good thing. But that's definitely not like I West specific, but I'm wondering how many conferences that are small conferences can actually really survive.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. And then the survive is kind of an interesting question as well because they don't tend to go on for that long. Yeah, I think three, four years is about the average lifespan. I mean, I think strangely grew a lot and I think it's part of part of why it's been able to stay around is that they're making a little more money every year. They're able to hire people to help out every year. Whereas friend of the show, Curtis, put on Cocoa Love, he did three years and was like, you know what, I'm good, I'm out.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, there's cocoa, love. What's the one in Canada that I think several of our friends went to? NS. Singleton.

Soroush Khanlou
Singleton. Yeah.

Chris Dzombak
I was sad that I never made it to that.

Soroush Khanlou
That is a really good one. I went to the last one of that and really enjoyed it. I had a good time there. There are a lot of conferences still. I will put a link to a GitHub repo that has a ton of information about conferences. Nice.

Chris Dzombak
Is it iOS specific conferences or there's.

Soroush Khanlou
Just a couple of ways it works. So one section is coco, only one is Cocomobile in general. And then there's like a historical section as well.

Chris Dzombak
Okay.

Soroush Khanlou
And the nice thing to do is if you watch this repo, if you click the little watch button, then you will get notifications every time conference organizers open a pull request to add their conference to this repo. Which is pretty cool. So that way I find out about the conferences as they're sort of announced. Kind of a nice centralized resource for that.

Chris Dzombak
That makes sense. I could see that. So I guess I came at this blog post from a very like, I wasn't going to too many conferences anyway perspective for you. Does this read more as a, like the end of small conferences. The end of the small conference era is here. Or is it like the end of these specific small conferences that my friends and I knew?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, it may be more of the latter. More of my friends stopped putting on conferences, so I stopped going to conferences. He says there's no single factor that has made it difficult, but the explosion of podcasts and YouTube over the last few years must have contributed significantly. Podcasts are a vastly more time efficient way to communicate ideas, and people who prefer crafting their messages or produced piece can do the same thing and more on YouTube. That being said, I don't see that much like on YouTube, and I don't see that many programming podcasts in the Cocoa community. There are a few, but it's not like there's so many that the conference talk is meaningless. Now.

Chris Dzombak
I kind of see where he's coming from. I have a backlog of things like programming videos to watch, CS videos to watch. Granted, I guess most of those are like videos of talks from one conference or another from years past. Yeah, I know. There is a community of people who produce and people who consume screencasts about programming.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, so Nscreencast is a cool thing. I've had the fortune of doing a couple of those as well, and that's a really fun format to do, but there's a lot more editing that goes into it. And although the money is there as well, you can actually sell subscriptions to it.

Chris Dzombak
Sure. And that's logistically easier than organizing or speaking at a conference.

Soroush Khanlou
Organizing something in meat space.

Chris Dzombak
I'd also throw out like there's gary Bernhardt's destroy All Software screencasts.

Soroush Khanlou
Right. And Brandon Williams and Steven Sealis also just launched Point Free, which is the same type of thing as a journal software, but more functionally and swift oriented.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. Okay. And there's the Swift Talk series from the folks behind objectsee IO.

Soroush Khanlou
Right. That's a good example too. I would maybe point to those before I pointed to YouTube as sort of the end of conference talks, although, and a lot of conference talks are really non technical, there's a big space for those as well. It's a weird thing. I mean, I think Marcos had some really good predictions in the past and maybe this one will come to pass and be proven correct and I guess we'll see in the next couple of years. But I'm not 100% convinced just because I've been seeing like just in America, we have two new ones this year. One is Swift Fest, which are in Boston, and one is Techie Con, which I'm speaking at in Atlanta.

Chris Dzombak
Oh, cool.

Soroush Khanlou
When's that techie con is. March 12 through 14th. Tickets are on sale now.

Chris Dzombak
Soon.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah.

Chris Dzombak
What are you going to be speaking about?

Soroush Khanlou
I think I'm going to do my you deserve nice things talk. I think that will end up being what it's about.

Chris Dzombak
I don't know if I've seen or heard this one.

Soroush Khanlou
There are a couple of videos of it online. Maybe we'll throw one in the show notes, but it's a little bit longer, so there'll be some new stuff in the Atlanta one if you're coming to Atlanta.

Chris Dzombak
Cool. All right. I guess that's all we have on that. I don't know. I just thought it was an interesting post, and I know you're way more in the conferencing than I am, so I wanted to hear your thoughts on it.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, another big part of it is that a lot of the conferences are in Europe, and that actually makes more sense for the Europeans because they all live so close together. They can take flights to see each other for $150 round trip, like really crazy, cheap flights. They can take the train. Getting around Europe is so much easier than getting around America.

Chris Dzombak
Imagine having a regional train system.

Soroush Khanlou
I won't let you derail this podcast into a train.

Chris Dzombak
That was a pun where's my.

Soroush Khanlou
But, yeah. Anyway, all I was trying to say is it's easier in Europe. And that's why you see a lot of conferences in Europe, and it's a little prohibitive for Americans to get to because you're talking about an overnight red eye to get there. You're talking about 600 $800 to fly there. You're talking about the lodging and the flights and everything all adding up. It does add up. But if you're already in Europe, it's not so bad.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. If you're traveling from America, it's a huge commitment. And it's a huge commitment for some from Europe to come to America for a conference.

Soroush Khanlou
That's right. I am, generally speaking, interested in the kind of bit that he mentions at the end. I don't know how to fix conferences, but the first place I'd start on that whiteboard is getting rid of all the talks, then trying to find a different way to bring people together and far more of them than before. I think this is kind of similar to XOXO's festival model and similar to kind of a retreat model. Or one thing that I found to be really nice is the time around a conference when everybody that you know is in the country that this conference takes place in. Like, this happened in Tokyo and in Australia last year, and just being able to say, like, okay, I'm on my own. But I also have a few friends in town who are in town for the same thing, speak same language as me, maybe have ideas on what to do. And being able to kind of organize with them and go to things is really fun, and it gives you this option, like, you can opt in to hang out with them, or you can opt to do something by yourself. And I think that can be kind of a relief. And I'd be interested to see some kind of event that's structured kind of like that, where it's like we're all just going to get together in this country, in this city. Feel free to come. Here's the general area we'll be in. And here's a slack group where we can organize dinner or whatever. Yeah, could be cool.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, maybe that's something that what's your project? That's supposed to help with this.

Soroush Khanlou
Which one?

Chris Dzombak
The WWDC meetup app.

Soroush Khanlou
Oh, Beacon. That's a good app.

Chris Dzombak
I'm totally failing at, like, plugging.

Soroush Khanlou
We'll start with WWDC this year and see where that takes us. I'm curious to see if Marco's kind of prediction here proves to be correct. My experience is that a few conference organizers kind of fall off because it is a very exhausting thing to organize these conferences, and then new people kind of pop up in their places and take up the mantle, so to speak.

Chris Dzombak
There's a conference organizer born every minute.

Soroush Khanlou
That's right.

Chris Dzombak
On that note, onto dynamic member lookup.

Soroush Khanlou
That sounds good to me. This was a very interesting proposal.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, definitely. This was one that I actually didn't read when it first went into review, but it's now been slightly revised, mainly for, I guess not naming, but for making something an attribute instead of a marker protocol.

Soroush Khanlou
Right, right. That's the very last change to it, right?

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, I think so. I think that was really the largest change to it from the previous revision, wasn't it?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. Let's talk about what the proposal suggests and then talk about implementation details. What do you think about that?

Chris Dzombak
I think that makes sense. So the goal with this proposal is especially to improve interop with languages like Python. I'm not sure why Python is the language that we're really talking about and interrupt with here. Do you have any idea why that's.

Soroush Khanlou
Like, the I have a suspicion. So the author of this proposal is none other than Chris Lattner, and he now works with a lot of Python at Google, and I think he wants to be able to call that stuff because isn't all of the Google machine learning thing what's that called?

Chris Dzombak
No idea, but I totally believe it's in Python.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, there's, like, a framework TensorFlow. I think all the TensorFlow stuff is Python, and so I think he wants to be able to call Python from Swift.

Chris Dzombak
That totally makes sense.

Soroush Khanlou
Okay, I may not be right, and I've heard rumors that Chris listens to the show, so Chris, if that's right, email me.

Chris Dzombak
Oh, man, that's so much pressure. Okay, so the idea here is to allow improving interrupt, we'll say, more broadly with dynamic languages. And there are also some other interesting use cases talking about, like, JSON processing everyone's favorite topic to just bike shed to death in Swift.

Soroush Khanlou
That's right. Yeah. So it's basically two parts that have been split up into two proposals. One is you want to have a property getter and setter, and you want to be able to call those dynamically. And then the other one is you want to have a function and you want to be able to call that dynamically.

Chris Dzombak
Right.

Soroush Khanlou
So this is just the property one, right.

Chris Dzombak
So this proposal, Swift Evolution One Nine Five, is intended to allow you to basically look up properties on a Swift type that aren't necessarily defined at compile time on that type, right?

Soroush Khanlou
Right. That is correct.

Chris Dzombak
So what this does is if you're accessing something with like dot property style syntax on a type that has this, what's this called the Dynamic Member lookup attribute applied, it means that that lookup is never going to fail at compile time. And what will happen is if there's not like if this Swift class here doesn't have a member by the name you're trying to access, then we'll fall back to basically subscript style access, which gives Runtime an opportunity to fetch this property from whatever object, be it like a dead JSON object or be it an object from the Python Runtime that you're trying to read.

Soroush Khanlou
Right. So another way to think about this is that you have some object, you have some reference to some object, and you could just type MyObject anything you want, any valid Swift Identifier, and that will compile. And then at Runtime, it will try and do something good with that. And if that fails, it will crash.

Chris Dzombak
I believe that is true. Yeah. So really this is a way to promote dot syntax for accessing members to subscripts at Runtime.

Soroush Khanlou
Right.

Chris Dzombak
And there's a lot I mean, this proposal goes into remarkable depth and detail. I don't know how much there really is to talk about. This seems like a pretty clear win, especially again for Dynamic Language Interop and for JSON, if we're still worried about parsing JSON nicely.

Soroush Khanlou
Right? Yeah. So the JSON thing is interesting. It means you can have a JSON object and just type name and it will look up the name, like whatever is at the name key, and it will just give that to you and it'll have some sort of vaguely typed thing like JSON object that everything that could come out of it conforms to. And you can just work with that. You could just type any key you want there. So that's a pretty cool usage of it, but absolutely. With due respect, I actually do think there is some interesting things to talk about here.

Chris Dzombak
Okay, yeah, let's hear it.

Soroush Khanlou
So I read the big swift evolution thread. It's like 150 posts.

Chris Dzombak
I have not it is, I think.

Soroush Khanlou
At this point, the most viewed post on Swift Evolution. One person brought up something that I do think is pretty valid, is that this really kind of changes how Swift works in maybe a good way, but maybe a bad way.

Chris Dzombak
In what way?

Soroush Khanlou
It means that now when you have a like, if you look at a piece of Swift code and you see an Identifier, you think that that Identifier is going to be checked in, that Identifier you wouldn't expect it to fail based on the code you've written in Swift's one through four. But now, because you don't know what type of reference that thing is just by looking at it, and because the type inference means that you don't have to suggest a type for whatever comes out of that property means that you could look at this code and it would look like static safe code, but in fact, it's secretly delegating at Runtime and could crash just from touching it.

Chris Dzombak
Well, I have two objections here.

Soroush Khanlou
I would love to hear them.

Chris Dzombak
So first of all, you'll have some awareness of this because the type that you're calling is going to be marked as dynamic member lookup, but not when.

Soroush Khanlou
You look at the code. Like you can dig into it and say, like, oh, I see that this call is dynamic.

Chris Dzombak
Sure. And you could imagine some tooling that maybe makes that a little bit clearer.

Soroush Khanlou
Sure.

Chris Dzombak
Chris also notes here that an implementation could provide several different still safe implementations. Here, this could always return an optional meaning that you'll have to handle whatever happens when this lookup fails, could return implicitly, unwrapped, optionals, so that like, you can deal with failures, but like, handles a common case of like, if this thing that I expect to work fails, then I'm just going to crash anyway. And the last option that he notes is like, just return non optional types and basically check and trap at Runtime if a call fails. I guess. I don't know if we've decided on one of these implementations yet, but I think at least options one and two can really make clear through the Swift type system that one of these accesses can fail or may fail at Runtime. And that's one of the things I like about this proposal. Between that and how it uses subscripts, this fits into existing language features, it can work really nicely with the Swift that we already know.

Soroush Khanlou
Right? Yeah, I see that. I hear that argument. I think it is a market departure though. And one of the kind of arguments I read in the thread was that you can already kind of do this with any object because I think any object represents ID. And anything that's ID you can call any message on, but almost nothing that you work with in the day to day of Swift is any object. Especially since they changed everything that's any object to be.

Chris Dzombak
Any, presumably pretty few things that you work with are going to be dynamic member lookup and dynamic callable too. Clearly. I think the right way to use this is to wrap these sort of interrupt types in your application model types so that you've contained this API search.

Soroush Khanlou
Right, but if that's the case, and again, we're like literally rehashing what happened in the thread, but if that's the case, then why not just use the actual subscripts with actual strings?

Chris Dzombak
Well, because that just sucks to write.

Soroush Khanlou
But it's only four more characters. It's an opening bracket, an opening quote, a closing quote, and a closing bracket.

Chris Dzombak
Well, it's actually only three more characters.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, that's true. Or maybe the question mark, if you're going to have it return optional by.

Chris Dzombak
Default, I mean readability, there's not a reason for your mind to have to context switch between code style just because you're reading slightly different Swift code.

Soroush Khanlou
Right? But if you're just writing bridges to stuff like Python anyway, then you don't have to look at it that much. You mostly are going to be looking at your strongly typed Swift wrapper. The other counterargument that I like to this proposal is like, is this really the right time?

Chris Dzombak
No time like the present.

Soroush Khanlou
Well, but there are times that are like the present. They're in the future. But Swift is in this very delicate state of abi stability is coming and every minute that's spent on this is a minute that isn't spent on getting a feature in the door. And I know Chris wrote an implementation for it. Really, it should just be dealing with this proposal and then dealing with the code review and making sure all the test pass and stuff. So it should be a pretty minimal impact. But I just wonder if this is the right focus for right now. Especially. I think he says there's not much abi impact. So I think that's good. I don't understand the abi stuff super well, we talked about it.

Chris Dzombak
I think the potential argument based on abi stability is just that effort by the Swift core team that goes into integrating this, even if there's an existing implementation is effort that's not going to.

Soroush Khanlou
Other priorities or even Chris's attention. I mean, I know he works at Google, but he could be working on other stuff too. I don't know if he still does do work, but that's also another side of it. So that's the other argument that I like I don't know.

Chris Dzombak
I mean, I don't really have a good counterargument besides like if the core team thinks that this is something worth spending time on, then we can spend time on it.

Soroush Khanlou
That's fair. The other cool thing that it's open to some pretty interesting abuse that I'm sure that I will do. So if you've ever written any Rails, if you have like, a model object, you can do if it has a name property. Like, let's say you have a blog post and the blog post has a title, you could just write the function. Blog post is in the class, find by title and then you pass it a title. When we get dynamic callability, you'll just be able to write that in Swift and it'll just convert at runtime to the right thing with method missing.

Chris Dzombak
Wait, what you're suggesting what? That you write the blog post title? Like an actual blog post? Wait, what are no.

Soroush Khanlou
So you want to find her, right? Like, let's say you want something that will find the first blog post with a given title.

Chris Dzombak
Okay.

Soroush Khanlou
In Rails, the way you'd write this is you write blog post the class, like capitalize B, capitalize P, find by title, and then you pass a title to that method. Right? It's a class method and you pass sure, but that method, why can't you.

Chris Dzombak
Write that in Swift?

Soroush Khanlou
Well, you can write it explicitly, but in Ruby, that method is metaprogrammed. So all you have to do is define the fact that there's a title property and it actually generates that for you. It generates the lookup for you.

Chris Dzombak
Okay? So just like I have to point out here, this is something you could do with sorcery in a totally, like, Swift typesafe, non abusive way here.

Soroush Khanlou
Yes, you could. You absolutely could. But with this proposal, you can just do this in raw Swift. Well, not this one. Sorry. The next one. Dynamic callable.

Chris Dzombak
Do we want to touch on dynamic callable here?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, I think so. I mean, this is the exact same as this proposal, but just lets you execute a function as well.

Chris Dzombak
Okay, cool. So rather than translating a call here into, like, a subscripting operation, it'll translate into a call through to a special dynamic call method with an array of tuples of arguments.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. Seems basically right to me.

Chris Dzombak
So it's up to your implementation of dynamic call to do something smart with those arguments, whether it's, again, using them for some sort of language interop, whether it's using them to dynamically look up an object, I don't know, in your Rails orm style database.

Soroush Khanlou
And you could just do that. And that is some shit I would do, Chris. That is absolutely some shit I would do.

Chris Dzombak
Oh, believe me, I am well aware.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. So I don't know, if you want.

Chris Dzombak
To give me that power, do that. Well, I mean, you have the power to do some crazy things right now, which you like what you're choosing not to do. Right. And everything's a trade off.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, that's true.

Chris Dzombak
You can choose to use this in, like, really in, like, pretty straightforward ways and try to isolate it in your code base, in which case, you're right, syntax maybe isn't quite so much a win, although I still argue that it's a huge readability win, which just makes maintenance and which makes, frankly, writing correct code easier. Right? Yeah. You can choose to use this to implement some fun, dynamic runtime sort of features within a totally pure Swift app, which maybe you trade off a little bit more, you trade off a little more risk for a bit more convenience. I mean, it's all like it's trade offs, right. And you're not making the trade off, I assume, to use unsafe pointers all throughout your app because, again, the trade off just isn't there for most use cases.

Soroush Khanlou
Right, but there I mean, it's literally called unsafe.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. Make smart decisions. Sirous.

Soroush Khanlou
I never signed anything that says I have to make smart decisions. You can't make me. No, I don't know. Dynamic callable. I think the dynamic member lookup will be kind of cool for some weird stuff like Firebase, where everything is sort of big dictionaries JSON everything is just big dictionaries. Dynamic callable is going to enable some very weird stuff and not to mention the base usage that they want of like, hey, you can now call Ruby, you can now call node code, you can now call other runtimes Python, whatever. But also you'll be able to write Swift code that does this, and you'll just have a Swift object that just responds to every single message. And it's your responsibility to kind of interpret those messages and do smart and cool things with them.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. And I mean, it's also your responsibility to, again, design a sane API and try to isolate things like this as much as is feasible or as much as makes sense in your application. I mean, it clearly is something like dynamic callable is something that if you are heavily leaning on it, is quickly going to become could at least quickly become kind of a maintenance nightmare. But there are other things I mean, there are other things that can become maintenance nightmares. Again, it's a trade off.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. You got to use, like you said, your judgment.

Chris Dzombak
You use your judgment. Right. This is Swift, so memory safety is preserved. Right. So we at least have that. And I mean, I guess this is definitely a, like, slightly weirder part of Swift than than normal plain old statically, like static compiled Swift. But weren't weren't weren't people really, really complaining about the lack of stuff like this in Swift a year or two ago? Yes, or four.

Soroush Khanlou
They were. This is an interesting one because there's some stuff that Sorcery can do that this still can't do. Right. Like bridging between strings and bridging between a string and their actual value. Yeah. I'm not sure how to express it, but let's say you have a bunch of enum cases. You want to pass a string and convert to an actual instance of the enum. You can't quite do that with this, whereas with Sorcery, you could write code that would generate the right thing to do that So. I mean, if you gave me the choice between this and something like Sorcery, I would take something like Sorcery. But I'm not interested in connecting Python to Swift. I'm interested in making right. I'm interested in making Swift more powerful. And I want the Swift code that I write to be more terse with some of the expressive power of Ruby or of something like what these proposals enable you to do. But I don't really have a need to connect to Sci Pi or NumPy or whatever or Tesla. And if you do, maybe it's good. So I've kind of taken a backseat. On the discussion on Swift evolution just because the people who do work with interrupting these layers really do want it. So maybe they just know better than me. And I've never done this, so I'm not the right person to speak to it, but it's a weird proposal to me.

Chris Dzombak
It doesn't seem quite so weird to me.

Soroush Khanlou
Well, you've already well, that's true.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. No, that's true. But we've talked for years about Swift gaining some more dynamic sort of features. This, I think, adds some of these in a type safe and memory safe way. Depending on the implementation, we can still guarantee that callers that you and your Swift code through the type system know about things that might fail and deal with it. It seems reasonable to me.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. I'm interested to see what this does to the language. This may end up being one of those dark corners, like objective C metaprogramming that nobody touches. It may be something that people who just want to interrupt with other layers touch, and it may end up being something else. So I guess this, like the previous mini topic, just have to kind of wait and see.

Chris Dzombak
It's impossible to predict, right. Maybe it'll be the purely the domain of people who are doing machine learning in Swift and people who are writing JSON. Parsing libraries in Swift.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. You'll be able to do some interesting things, that is for sure.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. On that note, do we want to wrap up?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, I think so.

Chris Dzombak
Anything else we wanted to no, I think this is good.

Soroush Khanlou
No, good luck. Good luck to Chris getting his proposal in, and we'll see what happens with five.

Chris Dzombak
For a second there, I thought you were talking to me, but in the third person, and I was extremely confused.

Soroush Khanlou
