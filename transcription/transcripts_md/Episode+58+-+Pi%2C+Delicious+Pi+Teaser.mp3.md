Speaker B
Interesting. So can you oh, and it's is it just always streaming, this playlist.

Speaker C
Yeah, it's just.

Speaker A
Yeah, you could just.

Speaker B
Tune into this at any time of the day and it would be playing.

Speaker C
Right. And this is how I get around.

Speaker A
The like, I don't have.

Speaker C
To coordinate the Raspberry Pi with, like, when I'm waking up. I just set the alarm clock for when I want to wake up. And there will be music.

Speaker A
Right.

Speaker B
So, I mean, I don't want to break something that's already working, but maybe you could get another Raspberry Pi to play with. Why don't don't you just hook up a speaker to the Raspberry Pi and just play that at a certain time?

Speaker C
Well, because I want to use my alarm clock that does the nice, like, 30 minutes, light fading thing while.

Speaker A
I.

Speaker B
Kind of thought that that was what the Raspberry Pi was doing. But that's the alarm clock.

Speaker A
No, this is its.

Speaker C
Own alarm clock, which is really nice. I highly recommend it.

Speaker B
Cool.

Speaker A
So that's a constraint.

Speaker C
So anyway, the project that I want.

Speaker B
To do right, okay. So that's two raspberry pi's. You're bringing a third into the house.

Speaker C
Yeah. The project I want to do if.
