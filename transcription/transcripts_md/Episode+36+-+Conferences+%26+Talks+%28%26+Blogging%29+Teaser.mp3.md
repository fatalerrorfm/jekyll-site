At a really high level. It was about, like, the mathematical simulation, how mathematical works to simulate certain kinds of systems. And, I mean, that's not something I use day to day, but it was really interesting.

Soroush Khanlou
Nice. I've seen topics like there's one that I really like called spreadsheets for developers, and it's a woman who writes, I think, insertion sort or selection sort using Excel. Well, not even using weird features of Excel. Just like straight up normal Excel and stuff like that. You don't find that at other conferences. And it's really cool.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, it is really cool. This isn't a strange loop talk, but we'll throw a link in the Show Notes too to this, I think, 15 minutes video where someone at a different conference implements a Turing machine in PowerPoint.

Soroush Khanlou
I saw that when I was wild.

Chris Dzombak
Because why not?

Soroush Khanlou
Because you can't.
