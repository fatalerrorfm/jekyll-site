Speaker A
Ah, yeah. Oh, wait, I hear an airplane. Ask aircraft radar, what is overhead? Shit, that sounds military. What does?

Speaker B
The aircraft are overhead. Assessment 210 M 0.1 mile east at 2400ft, heading east. Assessment citation c J three, 6 miles northwest at 12,200ft, heading northwest. Ner day 100 and 7200 LR 4.6 miles northwest at 33,000ft, heading east.

Speaker A
Whatever's flying overhead now is not one of those and sounds suspiciously like maybe.

Speaker B
It'S like an Area 51 situation.

Speaker A
Well, there's an Air Force or an Air National Guard base not close to here, but close in jet fighter terms. And so you do see fighters flying over every once in a while coming from their Selfridge Air National Guard Base there's also so I'm really close to the Willow Run Airport, which is where the I forget what it's called, but there was a famous bomber plant there in World War II. They made just hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of B 17s or B.

Speaker B
Guess all the car stuff was already in.

Speaker A
Right? This was like Henry Ford assembly line innovation to produce, like, a bomber just every hour for like, years, which is really crazy. And so there's like an airport or a museum and historical society at that airport that has a I forget if it's a B 17 or a B 24 and actually keeps it maintained and flies it. And if you donate a sufficient amount of money, you can actually get a ride in it. And so, on nice days, you'll see that flying over Ann Arbor, which is cool and which is pretty loud. Those things were not quiet, especially when it's flying over at like, 3000ft. So I still have a backlog of videos from Strange Loop that I want to watch that I'm slowly working my way through videos really quickly.

Speaker B
Right.

Speaker A
I was so impressed. Like, morning of day two, they announced that pretty much all the videos from day one were up on YouTube. We should probably start the show at this point.

Speaker B
All right, let's do it. All right. Welcome to Fatal Error. I'm Sirous.

Speaker A
And I'm Chris.

Speaker B
And if you're wondering what that bit was earlier, Chris made an echo skill and we talked about it on one of the Patreon episodes. It tells you what planes are flying overhead. So if you want to hear us talk about that, you can go grab the Patreon thing. And I think it's like episode 44.

Speaker A
Yeah, I don't remember exactly, but we'll throw a link in the show notes. We'll also put a link in the show notes just to the Skill web page if you want to try it out.

Speaker B
For sure. So our main topic today is that Chris was just at the Strange Loop conference in St. Louis and we kind of wanted to talk about what that was like.

Speaker A
Yeah, we're recording this October 8. This episode will come out in a week. And that's a little bit after Strange Loop, which was right at the end of September. So we're on a little bit of a delay here, but it was a really great conference. I don't know where to start, maybe.

Speaker B
So this is not your first Strange loop. This is your second Strange loop.

Speaker A
Yeah, that's right. I went last year as well. Got you last year. I, unfortunately was pretty sick for most of the conference, and so I kind of dragged myself to talks and sat in the back and tried not to get anyone sick and didn't talk to anyone. This year was a lot more fun because I was healthy.

Speaker B
What is general vibe there? I always picture it in my head as having a show floor, even though I know that that's wrong. There's no reason for there to be a show floor. There is it just like a hotel with a bunch of ballrooms and there's talks in the ballrooms or how does it work?

Speaker A
Yes, kind of. So this year was actually bigger than it has been in the past. The conference took place both in a hotel and in this opera house in downtown St. Louis. Previously, the conference took place entirely in the opera house, but these two venues are about a ten minute walk apart, and the organizers expanded to two venues this year to have more talks and let more people come. Because it's a popular conference, because it's great. Also note there's of course, like transit provided between the venues too, but it was nice weather, so I usually just walked.

Speaker B
Okay, so it sounds like Strangeloop is multi track given that it's in multiple venues. How many tracks are there at Strangeloop?

Speaker A
Okay, here. So I'm on the website and we'll throw a link to this schedule in the show notes because why not? At any given time, there were 123467 rooms going on that had talks in them, aside from the keynote anyway.

Speaker B
Right? That's a lot.

Speaker A
Yeah, definitely. It's a huge amount of talks. There were how many talks per day? Like maybe five or six talks per day, times six or seven rooms. There's a lot of stuff and it's generally speaking, really high quality. A lot of the talks that I went to are really interesting. And I guess we should mention, I think Strangelope has a reputation for being a little bit more of a like I don't necessarily want to say academic because it's like not an academic conference right. But a little bit more sort of theoretical, computer sciency, functional sort of theme. And I think that that is still true in part. I think it was probably more true a few years ago when they had fewer slots, because nowadays there were just a number of like it went to a talk about monitoring things in distributed systems, which is not really a functional programming sort of themed talk. It was just really interesting and useful. So there are a whole bunch of talks about all kinds of things I still have a list of talks that I didn't get to go to, which I'm slowly working through. This includes talks that I just didn't go to because there was something that seemed more interesting or something I wanted to see in person or I missed the first two talks on Friday because I went to karaoke Thursday night and that went till 230 in the morning.

Speaker B
Was it tough to pick between different talks?

Speaker A
Yeah, in a lot of cases it definitely was. Like in most of the time slots there were more than one or there was more than one talk that I really wanted to go to.

Speaker B
Nice. And then do you write down the ones you want to see later and to catch the videos?

Speaker A
Yeah, exactly. So I didn't really have a plan going in that I want to see this talk and this talk and this talk kind of just like every I don't know, every morning and every afternoon I looked at, okay, what's coming up, what I want to go to see. And then at the same time, just through the sessions that I wasn't going to go to into my task management app. And so I just have a list there. Since you mentioned videos, I'll also note, especially this year, the organizers and the video crew, I guess, were really good about getting videos up amazingly quickly. I feel like I remember a few years ago waiting weeks and weeks for strange loop videos to go online and now this year on the morning of day two, they announced that most of the videos from day one were already online on YouTube for people to watch.

Speaker B
Which is so crazy incredible.

Speaker A
Just think about the logistics that go into making that happen. It's so impressive.

Speaker B
Yeah, especially like five tracks at once. Seven tracks at once.

Speaker A
Yeah. It's kind of mind blowing. And I'll also note seems like I'm kind of monologuing here, but one more thing to note. The Strangeloop is, I think a really well organized and well done conference. I think Alex Miller, who's the main organizer, and all the volunteers who come together to run it, do a really amazing job. They take care of all the things that a lot of conferences don't do so well. There's a clear code of conduct and ways for violations of the code of conduct to be dealt with right. For the keynotes and in a couple of the talks, they have live captioning in real time of what the speaker is saying, which is really cool. And that's a great thing, both for accessibility, for people who are hard of hearing, or just like I found it really helpful just to sit near that so that I could follow what was going on better. Right, yeah, it's a really well put together conference. I'm really happy with it.

Speaker B
The live capturing stuff is really hard, but it's so useful when it's done well, where you could just see the thing, and if you missed a word, you could just look at it, regardless of whether you need that closed caption or not, because you're deaf. It's just helpful.

Speaker A
Yeah, absolutely. You can tune out for 5 seconds and come back and know what's going on without being yeah.

Speaker B
Which can be really nice. And you mentioned earlier you mentioned that there were shuttles between the two different venues, between the hotel and the operas. I assume that that was, like, an accessibility thing. Some people can't walk ten minutes.

Speaker A
Yeah. I mean, what I can walk in ten minutes is not something that everyone can walk in ten minutes.

Speaker B
Yeah, that's really nice.

Speaker A
Plus, I mean, what if it was raining? You don't want to there's that, too.

Speaker B
Also, I mean, I've been to conferences where they don't make those kind of affordances, so it's nice to know that there are people that do that. That do.

Speaker A
Yeah.

Speaker B
Cool. It sounds like it's a good conference. I've always really wanted to go. I've seen a lot of cool talks online from Strangeloop. What was there this year that you particularly liked, you thought was super interesting?

Speaker A
So there were a few talks that I thought were really interesting, and there are a few talks that I think will be interesting that I haven't watched the videos for yet. And we'll maybe add a section to show notes. That is just talks I haven't watched, but I want to. So one of my favorite talks was from a guy from Stripe, Sam Ritchie, and this was about machine learning and explaining decisions that AIS make or that machine learning models make. And so I came into this not knowing much about machine learning at all, but the premise of the talk was kind of like, okay, so let's say we have machine learning models that are trained to do all kinds of things. Now, at Stripe, maybe you have a machine learning model that's trained to determine whether a given transaction is fraudulent. People want explanations for why some transaction was marked as fraudulent, for example, or, like, why an autonomous car made some whatever decision it made.

Speaker B
Right, right.

Speaker A
And that, I guess, has typically been kind of like if you have a complicated or like, a very large machine learning model, then explaining why it did something can be kind of hard if you're just looking at the if you're just looking at the model itself. And so Sam spent a little while explaining how decision trees work, how decision tree learning works, what random forests are. And I came out of this actually understanding this stuff quite a bit better than I did before, which is great. And then he went into explaining one way to generate an explanation post hoc, like, after the fact, that explains or comes up with a one plausible explanation for why the model made the decision that it made. And I thought that was pretty cool. I pretty much followed it. Although I don't know if I can do justice explaining that here, but if you're interested in this kind of thing, I think you should go watch this talk. I thought it was really interesting.

Speaker B
For show notes.

Speaker A
Yeah, even if you don't know that you're interested in machine learning. This I thought was interesting both as a way to learn a little bit more about what is a random forest, what does that mean and how can we come up with so the process that he describes involves training another machine learning model on explanations for what the first model is doing. But it actually works. It sounds kind of crazy, but it actually works, which is wild. So that was a really interesting talk. And that brings me to sort of, I don't know, like a theory of how to choose talks that I came up with halfway through this conference was.

Speaker B
I definitely want to hear this.

Speaker A
Well, so a lot of at least at this conference I don't know if this applies everywhere, but a lot of the talks that I went to initially seemed to be like talks in areas where I know a lot of things. I noticed for the first day of this conference, I tended to go to a lot of talks for areas that I knew a lot about and they were interesting and good talks, but I didn't come away with a lot of new a lot of new ideas or anything. And so I kind of figured for a conference like this, where there are a bunch of broad topics and all sorts of different talks, to go to the right thing to do, at least for me, was definitely to go to talks like this where I know next to nothing about machine learning. And this is really interesting and I'm expanding my brain and how I think about different things. And I tried to do that with the other talks that I chose and I think it worked out really well.

Speaker B
So the idea is basically pick things that you know the least about that still sound interesting, right?

Speaker A
Exactly. For one example, there was a talk about web authentication, like various problems. Turns out that authenticating people on the web is a hard problem still. And so one of the reasons I picked this talk was one of the speakers, you may know her on Twitter as at Bcrypt, is a really interesting person and has done all sorts of interesting work in the sort of computer security, computer privacy space. And this was a great talk about all the different problems that are hard still in web authentication and what you should do if you're building a system that handles web authentication. And it was really great and I think did a really good job of covering all this stuff. But I didn't really come away from it with many new ideas or having expanded my brain much at all. And that's not because it wasn't a good talk. It was a really great talk that did a great job of covering of covering this space. But kind of after that and after one or two other talks, I kind of decided I need to go to things that I don't already know about.

Speaker B
Right. You'll get the most out of those.

Speaker A
Right. And if this were like a conference, if it were, like, dubbed Up DC, there are a lot of more advanced talks that dive more into more technical detail because it's it's more focused for something like this. I think it's it's more about, like, exposing yourself, at least for me, more about exposing myself to different areas and different problem spaces and things like that.

Speaker B
Right. I remember a thing from do you ever build and analyze the very first Marco podcast?

Speaker A
Yeah, I didn't listen to too many episodes of that, but yeah, there was.

Speaker B
This thing he talked about he talked about going to WWDC and picking talks that sound like they could be interesting even if you don't really know what they're about. And so there was one talk about API design, and he thought that that meant, like, rest JSON http API design, but it actually meant, like, designing the names of your objective C methods and how Apple chooses that stuff. And he was like, yeah, it was actually a really useful talk and explained a lot about how that stuff works and how I should implement it in my own thing. And I didn't expect to like that talk a lot, but it turned out to be super, super useful.

Speaker A
Yeah, absolutely. I think. Okay, cool. So I'm realizing that same thing just years and years and years later.

Speaker B
Yeah. It's like one of the very few things I do remember from that show. I don't know if we could find that actual episode from the but maybe we'll try to find a link for it and put it in the show notes, but yeah.

Speaker A
So all that said, while I'm on the subject, this talk about web authentication, which had a great title, it was it me under the Hood of Web Authentication is a really great talk on all these different issues. If you've ever wondered about what do you mean by Bcrypt? What does salting a password mean? How do what what happens when, like, a web server is using a cookie to, like, associate you with your session? And, like, how do you do that correctly? And what are timing attacks and what are side channels and do those work over the network? And what is multifactor authentication? And I keep hearing that using SMS messages for two factor auth is a bad idea. Why is that? Is it really that easy to hack? You should definitely watch this talk because it's really interesting.

Speaker B
Nice. That sounds super good.

Speaker A
Yeah, it was really good talk. Let's see other interesting talks. There was a talk by Leto Nikolai, and again, there'll be links to all this stuff in the Show Notes entitled Rewriting History. And so his pitch for this talk was kind of, we're going to rewrite git, not by knowing how it works and re implementing it, we're going to discover it. So he kind of takes the tack that like, okay, so we want to make a Source Control system. What does that mean? What are the first decisions that we have to make? And why do we make these decisions? And sort of works through in Ruby? Okay, so here's a really basic system that you can give it some bytes and it'll store them and you can address them and read them back and then kind of builds on top of that, explaining the decisions that are being made throughout the process to the point where he has a source control system written in ruby that he can create commits which are like a set of files and directories.

Speaker B
Right? That's crazy. Is that like live coded or I.

Speaker A
Think it wasn't live coded. It was, I think, recorded videos of him having previously coded.

Speaker B
Wow, that's amazing.

Speaker A
And so the end of this, which was pretty cool, you could kind of see where this is going, right. But he took the repo that we had been working in and created with his Ruby code and was like, and now if we rename this Source control directory to get switch over the terminal and type git status, turns out that literally had written code that wrote objects out in the same format as git. And it's pretty straightforward.

Speaker B
Wow.

Speaker A
Which is cool, right? Because as much as I know roughly how git works and what it means to have a content addressable storage and how it's just a distributed Acyclic graph, right. It's all pointers, which these are all words, but it's a pretty simple system under the hood, really. I had never thought about some of the sort of lower level decisions about how, say, directories get represented and he did a good job of explaining this stuff. And now I know a little bit more about git than I did before. So that's cool. That's something you should watch.

Speaker B
Nice. Yeah. We'll have to find out for the Show Notes as well. That'll be really sick. I definitely want to watch that.

Speaker A
Yeah. Another cool talk was, let's see, level up your concurrency skills with Rust. Guy named David Solins gave this talk. And so the gist here is data race conditions exist in programming. Rust makes that Rust can basically eliminate those because of its very clear ownership and lifetime and borrowing model for memory management. That's something that I think we've covered a little bit when we've talked in the past about adding move semantics to Swift or somewhere earlier we talked about the ownership manifesto, right?

Speaker B
Right.

Speaker A
So I definitely recommend that talk. It'll be interesting. If you're interested in thinking about move semantics and ownership and what that could bring to Swift and what benefits come with that.

Speaker B
Nice. Yeah, sort of to wrap up. Is there anything that you want to say, like, in closing, about Strangeloop, what it feels like to be there, what the vibe is?

Speaker A
Yeah, absolutely. It's a really great conference that I really enjoyed. It's a very sort of welcoming and inclusive vibe. I think it brings together a lot of the sort of or for whatever reason, it tends to attract the sort of inclusive, sort of progressive crowd of programmers, I think, which is really interesting. Man, there are so many other interesting talks, too, that I didn't get a chance to mention here and some interesting talks that I haven't even watched yet.

Speaker B
Maybe what we should do is dump a bunch of them in the show notes of anything you thought was interesting, and that could just be a source for people to go find cool stuff.

Speaker A
Well, even better, what if we just we'll link to the full schedule for this year's Strange Loop and the YouTube playlist with all of the talks, and you can choose your own adventure.

Speaker B
Nice. That sounds pretty good.

Speaker A
Yeah, the organizers did a great job. The speakers did a great job. I really appreciate everyone who contributes to something like this. Someday I will give a talk about something somewhere. I'm glad that I had a chance to reflect a little bit on how to make the best use of a conference like this, at least for me. And, yeah, that's what I've got.

Speaker B
Nice. That sounds pretty cool. I feel like I should go to strange loop once. I feel like it's such an interesting experience that I feel like it's a big experience at least once.

Speaker A
You know, the other nice thing, it's a shorter time commitment and it's much less expensive than going to, for example, WWDC, and it's much less expensive than going to almost any conference that happens on one of the coasts or certainly internationally. Yeah, I highly recommend it.

Speaker B
Nice. Cool. Well, that's episode 47 of our podcast. Please like and subscribe. Smash that like button. Thanks, everybody, for listening to all of our Patreon people. Thank you for subscribing to the Patreon and helping us with all of our editing costs and hosting costs means a lot to us. People who aren't on the Patreon may notice that Chris and I sound a little bit better this week than last week. We've gotten new mics, and we've only talked about on the Patreon, but we haven't talked about it in public yet. But to the Patreon people, thank you so much.

Speaker A
Yeah, thank you so much for your support. We really appreciate that. There will be a link to Patreon in the show notes. That's where all the even numbered episodes have run off to. One more thing before we leave you. Strange Loop every year has a party, which is at the City Museum in St. Louis, and that place is wild. And I'll leave it at that. We'll put a link in the show notes. Okay, I think we're done.

Speaker B
I think we're done here. All right.
