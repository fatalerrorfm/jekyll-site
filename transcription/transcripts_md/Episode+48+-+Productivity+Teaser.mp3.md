You are like a diehard getting things done person. You got, like, the whole Omni Focus set up. You got all your contexts. And I have tried multiple times in the past to get into the whole system, and I can't do it. And so I feel like I'm behind somehow. So I want to talk about that.

Chris Dzombak
No. Two important things right out front. First of all, as of a couple months, a month or two ago, three months ago maybe, I'm not really using Omni Focus anymore.

Soroush Khanlou
Huge breaking.

Chris Dzombak
Breaking indeed. Big news. Big news. Second of all, it's fine. You're not behind anything. You can organize your life however you want, or you cannot organize your life. And it's fine. It's all fine.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. I don't know. I just see people who I respect who do a lot of work, and they're doing the Omni Focus. And every time I try, I just fall flat on my face. I, like, literally bought every version of things, every version of OmniFocus Things Two, things Three. And I paid probably $300 for productivity software.
