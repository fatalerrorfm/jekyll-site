Speaker A
Hey, buddy.

Speaker B
Hey. How's it going?

Speaker A
Pretty good. What's up with you?

Speaker B
Not a whole lot. Recording a podcast.

Speaker A
Oh, that sounds pretty good.

Speaker B
Yeah, it's great. You should try it. Should get into this podcast is going to be huge for I think it's going to be big. It's probably fad how's what I was.

Speaker A
Going to say, how's your week going? I guess your week just started, but how's your week been since the last time we talked?

Speaker B
Ah, it's been good, man. What what happened in the last week? Yeah. I don't know. It's it's been pretty good. I feel like I've done a lot of stuff. I did a lot of social stuff this weekend. Saw Black Panther, which is good. You should go see it.

Speaker A
I have not seen Black Panther yet.

Speaker B
I do recommend it.

Speaker A
Sorry.

Speaker B
I definitely recommend it.

Speaker A
Yeah, I hear it's really, really good. I'm very excited about it. I tried to go today, but the theaters were all sold out. Today's Monday, President's Day in America.

Speaker B
Okay.

Speaker A
And I didn't realize that everybody was off until I was, like, at the theater. It was sold out for the next four showings. That didn't wow.

Speaker B
We just walked into a theater Saturday at 01:00 in the afternoon and bought, like, five tickets.

Speaker A
Wow.

Speaker B
Was the theater packed or I mean, it was busy. It wasn't packed by any means. Other people around Ann Arbor have been having similar problems similar to you, like getting tickets. I don't understand how we managed to pull this off.

Speaker A
I guess have you heard about this new Movie Pass thing?

Speaker B
I have a movie pass, in fact.

Speaker A
Oh, nice. There you go. I have a movie pass, too.

Speaker B
I feel like we could really talk about this. It's a cool service. I've used it.

Speaker A
Let's explain. For people who don't know what it is, we got to bring the people with.

Speaker B
You pay $10 a month, and you get to see movies for your $10 a month, subscription free.

Speaker A
You get to see one movie a day.

Speaker B
You just see one two dimensional movie per day.

Speaker A
Right. It's stuck in two D. And I.

Speaker B
Think the catch is that they sell all of the data about who's seeing what movies to movie studios, kind of.

Speaker A
I was actually listening to a podcast with a guy today. It was like, oh, really? It was recode media. I'll put it in the show notes if people want to listen. But basically it's kind of a genius thing. He was saying. When people first get it, they go crazy. They buy a bunch of movies, but then over time, they kind of taper off to about one movie a month.

Speaker B
Okay.

Speaker A
And then the average ticket price in the country is about 850 or $9. So depending on who's using it and how much they kind of more or less break even the way that they make money. They can make money selling ads, but they can also make money making deals with the movie theaters and saying right now they're kind of basically holding up AMC. And they're saying, we deleted you from our app. And these I think they deleted ten of their theaters in really populated areas where there's a really easy alternative. So there's an AMC in Times Square and then across the street I think there's a Regal. And so they just deleted the AMC and they said, we're responsible for about 5% of their ticket sales for that location. And that's just like, wow, that's just like their loss. And they're saying everybody just goes across the street to the other movie theater. And so what they want is they are saying, we can fill up your movie theater for movies that are like, everybody's going to go see Star Wars, but they said, we can fill up your movie theater for the shape of water or whatever, and we want a small percentage of that. And of course AMC doesn't take kindly to terrorists or whatever trying to hold them up, stick them up for money, negotiate with that's. Right. And so they're basically like kind of in a standoff situation right now.

Speaker B
I didn't realize that. I was totally under the impression it was a pretty straightforward like they basically break even on tickets and then sell data to studios operation.

Speaker A
You don't get that much information as the thing because all you get is the ability to track the user across different movie theaters. Just good, I guess. But I think they know that if you see Dr. Strange, you're probably also going to see Black Panther.

Speaker B
I guess that's true. Especially with what advertising networks can do. They probably can tie people. They probably can gather profile information about you and tie that to the movies that you tend to see and maybe other viewing habits when you tend to go to see movies. Anyway, it's a cool service. I've seen more movies in the last two months since I signed up for this than I had seen probably in the three years before this combined.

Speaker A
Yeah. The other nice thing is I don't know how much movies cost in Ann Arbor, but here movie tickets, like 16 or $17. So you're more than paying for it if you see a movie every month.

Speaker B
Movie ticket here is like eight to $10.

Speaker A
Yeah, that's like a normal price. But like, here is obviously crazy.

Speaker B
Yeah. New York. Greatest city in the world. Greatest city in the world. So did you get the new Movie Pass app update? Just recently?

Speaker A
I was actually on the beta for it. It's much better than the old version of the app.

Speaker B
It is much better than the old one. The old one had not been updated for iPhone X and the navar not.

Speaker A
Being updated for the iPhone X is like the smallest of their problems. That was a tragedy.

Speaker B
It was just a disaster. And I still do. Movie Pass is still on thin ice for me because that app was so terrible and because not this past weekend, but two weeks ago when this episode comes out, a couple of my friends and I had gone to see a movie, just like some Sunday morning, and we tried to use Movie Pass and it just didn't work. Just gave us an error. So we all bought our $8 movie tickets and went to see Movie anyway. But back to but defeats the like, I wouldn't have been there spending $8 if I had known I was going to have to spend $8.

Speaker A
Right, that's true.

Speaker B
Anyway, how did we get down this road? The new app does look a lot better. The jury is still out, I think, on whether it actually works better or more reliably.

Speaker A
Right, yeah. It requires you to be within 100 yards of the theater, which I think is kind of annoying.

Speaker B
Wasn't that the case before?

Speaker A
It's still the case.

Speaker B
Yeah.

Speaker A
I was trying to use it today to go to see Black Panther.

Speaker B
Yeah, I don't know. That makes sense, I guess.

Speaker A
Yeah, it's fine. I wish it were more like my movie is in an hour or something. Like it was a different because 100 yards is just like, I kind of want to do it while I'm on the way to the theater or something.

Speaker B
Yeah. And my group of friends and I did. We also got burned, but just because for no reason other than we were at a bar drinking beer until past the time when we should have left to see the movie. And so we got to the theater we got to 100 yards from the theater as the time for the movie rolled around. And movies don't start until, what, 1520 minutes because of previews. But it disappears from Movie pass right when it says it's going to start the theater at 01:00. For a 01:00 movie, you're screwed.

Speaker A
Interesting.

Speaker B
There is a button, which we found the hard way.

Speaker A
There is a button that you can say, I want to go to a movie that's not listed here.

Speaker B
Oh, really?

Speaker A
I don't know how that in the old app.

Speaker B
I don't know.

Speaker A
I saw it today, but I didn't need to use it, so I don't know how it works. It's also currently $8 a month, which is maybe worth canceling and re subscribing.

Speaker B
Wait, really? Yeah, I think I'm paying $10 a month.

Speaker A
I'm paying ten, but it says, like, limited time offer, 8795 a month.

Speaker B
Is that like perpetual?

Speaker A
Oh, sorry. Offer available to first time subscribers paid annually, so we couldn't get it anyway. And you have to pay annually.

Speaker B
That's how they get you. Let's try to get you I'm not convinced enough that this is going to work, reliably to pay annually, in all honesty.

Speaker A
But they said they have like a million and a half subscribers, which is.

Speaker B
That'S a lot of people, I think that they've been around for a while, but have grown really substantially over the.

Speaker A
Last yeah, a lot more expensive. It used to be like $40 a month and it was for people who see, like, crazy, crazy movies. Yeah, but now it's rich.

Speaker B
Yeah. I remember back at a I don't know, right around the holiday, right around Christmas, one of our friends told us about this and our minds were blown. And apparently he's had this card for a little while. I think a lot of people just learned about it over the last couple of months.

Speaker A
Yeah, it really blew up. I feel like I hear about it everywhere. I hear about it. I know on podcasts, like Fatal Error. I hear about it lots of places.

Speaker B
He said the name of the show. Should we move on to a ten minute free adverb?

Speaker A
Yeah, it works pretty good if you watch movies. It's good. You should get it. It's america only. I know we have listeners abroad, but.

Speaker B
Yeah, sorry, I have a small mini.

Speaker A
Topic for us, if you're interested.

Speaker B
I am interested.

Speaker A
I have an update on the Wimo situation in our household.

Speaker B
So we're going to move from really talking up some service to talking about how bad something is.

Speaker A
Maybe, I don't know. Where do you think this topic is going to go?

Speaker B
I have no idea. I guess I assume things have improved since apparently you still have Wimo equipment and Taylor hasn't made you get rid of it yet.

Speaker A
Yeah. Yes. So listeners of this show, remember episode 50, which is maybe the best episode we've ever done, the funniest, at least.

Speaker B
I think our reactive episodes are pretty good.

Speaker A
That's true too. But either way, we brought my girlfriend on and the three of us talked about our home automation setup in our house. So after that show came out, I was kind of listening back to it and I was like, am I really just putting my girlfriend through this horrible experience? And is it really worth it? So what I did is I basically hung a little notebook. I hung a little notebook next to the Wimo that fails the most, and I just put a pen next to it and said, like, if it ever fails, just like, write down the date here and write down what happened. So we recorded this. Yeah, go ahead.

Speaker B
Are you tracking the times that it works correctly, too?

Speaker A
No, I mean, I assume everything that's not labeled is working correctly.

Speaker B
Well, yeah, but how do you know how frequently it's failing if you only record the error?

Speaker A
Well, we use it every day. I feel like, okay, it's the main light in the house. That is the button. Press, like, turn the house.

Speaker B
All right, fair enough.

Speaker A
So, yeah, so I put this notebook there and we recorded the episode, I think in November, maybe. So it's been maybe three months, maybe four months since we recorded that was.

Speaker B
Earlier than November, even I think.

Speaker A
Well, it was the end of season three either way. It's been a couple of months. It's been a couple of months. And I've learned two important facts. One is the failure mode that we thought we were experiencing the most, which is that you'd push the button and it wouldn't trigger the lights in the living room and the dining room has happened once in that entire time.

Speaker B
Okay.

Speaker A
Yeah.

Speaker B
So are you seeing other failure modes then?

Speaker A
There's one other failure mode, which is that the Wimo periodically restarts itself, and while it's restarting, it's blinking green and you can't use it. And so it seems like it's inactive or whatever.

Speaker B
Why does it need to reboot itself?

Speaker A
I don't know. I don't know. I've been talking to Remo support, but they don't know either. Yeah, so basically I've also been tracking that one, and that's happened maybe five or six times in the last three months, so not like a horribly high amount. And also it's like five or six times that it's been restarting while I've been pushing the button. Maybe it's restarting in the middle of the night, but I don't know because I'm not trying to turn on light in the middle of the night.

Speaker B
Maybe this is just when they're issuing, like, firmware updates. Does it know?

Speaker A
The firm updates are done through the app, so that's specifically done.

Speaker B
So is the takeaway here that it's actually working way more reliably than I was given to understand back in November.

Speaker A
What ended up happening was when it was failing a lot, it was because of a specific version of Home Assistant.

Speaker B
Is the can you remind me what all Home Assistant does, please?

Speaker A
Home Assistant is like HomeKit on steroids, so basically it runs on a Mac mini or a Raspberry pi or whatever, and it's python, and you can just program everything into it so you can say, when I get home and the lights are off, do this. You can just write little scripts in YAML to do stuff. That's the YAML configuration file thing, if you remember that.

Speaker B
Right? Yeah.

Speaker A
So it turns out that the version of that that was causing all of our problems once we downgraded to a version that worked and then they fixed the bug, and I think we eventually upgraded all the way back up, although I need to double check that. But once we got off the bad version, it just works pretty reliably.

Speaker B
Okay, so your main problem turned out to be a bug, not with WeMo, but with the software you were using to do things with Wimo that WeMo doesn't let you do. Natively.

Speaker A
That's right.

Speaker B
If I'm remembering right, you're using Home Assistant to group multiple lights together under one switch.

Speaker A
Yeah, it's because we have no lights in the living room and dining room, which are kind of connected, and there's no outlets that are controlled by light switches. So you would have to walk over there to turn it on. So what we end up doing is there's a foyer light. And so when you hit that button, it also triggers the living room and the dining room lights. And when it works, it's actually totally seamless. And, like, people who come in don't even know that there's, like, mac mini with running python making this happen, which is nice.

Speaker B
This entire time, for the last several months, I've just been, like, walking into my apartment, flipping a light switch, and lights turn on and sighing. A Breath of Relief works 100% of the time. As a side note, you mentioned Raspberry Pi. And maybe after this, I have a fun Raspberry Pi project I'm going to do that we can chat about.

Speaker A
Nice. So that's half of the WeMo story. I could wrap this up. We could talk about Raspberry Pi's.

Speaker B
Okay. What's the other half?

Speaker A
The other half is that WeMo finally launched their they call it a bridge. And what it is, is a small piece of hardware. It's like the size of a matchbox. Maybe maybe a little bit bigger. And it connects your home bridge. Sorry. It connects your home kit to your wimos. So now I can say, hey, siri, turn off the light in the office.

Speaker B
Okay.

Speaker A
And now I'm sitting here in the dark.

Speaker B
Oh, that seems great. And so are some of our listeners.

Speaker A
Well, if they have offices, turn the lights on in the office.

Speaker B
Isn't, siri more like sensitive to tune to your voice these days? Specifically.

Speaker A
I think so. But I think it depends also on the device. I think the HomePod answers everybody. Oh.

Speaker B
Do you have a HomePod?

Speaker A
I don't.

Speaker B
Get one.

Speaker A
Yeah, probably not.

Speaker B
We can talk about that later. Okay.

Speaker A
We mo. Bridge is working totally flawlessly. HomeKit is really good. Cool. I don't have any need for the automations because I can write way more advanced automations in home assistant, so I don't really worry about that. But getting to talk to Siri to use the lights is nice. So sometimes I'll be sitting and working on the computer and I'll realize that it's daytime, but haven't turned on the light yet. So instead of even moving my fingers from the mouse, I'll just tell the robot lady to turn on the lights. And it just does. And it's kind of nice.

Speaker B
That is cool. Yeah.

Speaker A
So that's working pretty well as well. Basically, things are all right in the Wimo world. We got to bring Taylor on to validate everything that I've said, though.

Speaker B
Yeah, I'm not sure I totally believe you, but no, it sounds like things really have come together quite a lot, which is great. And I mean, as much as I joke about it, it is frustrating to have outlets that aren't controlled by light switches and just have no nice way to control those lights.

Speaker A
Yeah, it was pretty during the first few months we moved in, where it was just like you got to walk over. And what would end up happening more often than not is Taylor would come home from work and just sit on the couch in the dark. You deserve better than that.

Speaker B
Yeah. Okay, cool. So you're doing that on a Mac Mini?

Speaker A
Yes.

Speaker B
Why did you choose out of curiosity, why did you choose Mac Mini instead of a Raspberry Pi?

Speaker A
So part of it is that I have a Mac Mini line around.

Speaker B
All right, that's a strong argument.

Speaker A
Yeah. It's running my Plex for all my legally downloaded Internet.

Speaker B
For your Linux ISO.

Speaker A
I stream my Linux ISOs off of that box. That's good. And then it's easier to work with because I don't have to SSH into it or find a monitor for it because it's always hooked up to the TV. It's a Mac, so I know how it works. I know how to make, like, auto launch scripts and stuff on. It just easier, basically. Okay, so tell me about you're thinking about a Raspberry Pi project.

Speaker B
Yeah, I have a Mac Mini here that runs Plex and runs a bunch of other things for me. I've running this I forget what it's called, but it's the software that turns my printer at home into an air print compatible thing. So I can print from my iPhone once a year. Nice. And I have a couple of Raspberry Pi's doing, like, fun and interesting things. One is like, monitoring or receiving tracking signals from aircraft around for, like, the 50 miles around my house.

Speaker A
Now, do you need a piece of hardware for that as well that has.

Speaker B
A little, like, software defined radio USB dongle. It's like a $20 piece of hardware and then I have an antenna mounted in a window.

Speaker A
Software defined radio?

Speaker B
Software defined radio, yeah.

Speaker A
How does that work?

Speaker B
Well, you're really putting me in the spot here. You have radio chips that are really versatile and they can work across a very, very wide frequency range. And so rather than having hardware that is tuned to receive in a specific frequency range, and maybe you have some tuning hardware that can tune within, like the FM band that you might listen to. Right. Which is what, 87 to 108 MHz or so. You may have a software defined radio transceiver that can operate over a much, much wider range of frequencies. And it does this by, I think, at least for receiving with fancy, like, digital signal processing, basically on the radio waves that it picks up. That's probably a pretty poor introduction to it. But the upshot of it for projects like this is that you can get like a little cheap $20 dongle and work across huge frequency range, receive all sorts of signals, tune into your ham radio bands, you can tune into the FM radio that you would just listen to. You can listen to aircraft transmissions. Oh, that's another thing, is that with the software defined radio, you can tune into both Am and FM style transmissions rather than having hardware that limits you to just one of those two methods of radio communication. So it's a really versatile way to do radio, basically, right? Anyway, I have one of these set up to receive signals, what we call ADSB signals from aircraft that are around and share them to Flight Aware and Planefinder and a couple of other sites that collect this data and use it to power apps and other fun applications. That's part of what's powering my lady in a Tube skill so you can ask what aircraft are around. I have another Raspberry Pi in my apartment that is part of my alarm clock system, which okay, hold on.

Speaker A
You are not allowed to make fun of me for having computer light switches if you have a Raspberry Pi alarm clock.

Speaker B
Yeah, I mean, that's fair. So the Raspberry Pi is only part of the alarm clock, right? I have this clock that I have an alarm clock by my bed that is one of these alarm clocks that lights up slowly for like half an hour before you wake up. The idea is that it makes it helps wake you up in a more gentle fashion and it has an FM radio on it. So I thought it would be really cool if I could play a custom playlist on there instead of just tuning into NPR in the morning, because these days, the last thing I want to wake up to is the news. The news. And so I got a little raspberry pi. It's a raspberry pi. Zero. W the little $10 thing? And there's software you can run on it that is a total hack, but that uses some of the some of the digital input output systems on the processor to generate FM radio signals. And it's just powerful enough that if you attach an antenna to the board, you can pick it up from like a couple of feet away. Which is really cool because what this means is that I have a little raspberry pi sitting just, like, under my bed with a little antenna on it, and it just loops through. It's just a bash script. Script that loops through a directory of MP3 s on the raspberry pi and just continuously plays them over like an FM band. That's not used around here.

Speaker A
Wow.

Speaker B
So what that means is that I.

Speaker A
Can'T believe I've been duped like this for so many years. I didn't know you do this, Chris.

Speaker B
Oh, I totally do. So I can just open Transmit on my Mac and drop files in this folder and then they're just constantly, randomly being played, which means that whenever I set my alarm to, I just have, like, I come into this playlist at a random point.

Speaker A
Interesting. Is it just always streaming, this playlist?

Speaker B
Yeah, you could just tune into this.

Speaker A
At any time of the day and it would be playing.

Speaker B
Right. And this is how I get around the like, I don't have to coordinate the Raspberry Pi with, like, when I'm waking up, I just set the alarm clock for when I want to wake up. And there will be music. Right.

Speaker A
I don't want to break something that's already working, but maybe you could get another Raspberry Pi to play with. Why don't you just hook up a speaker to the Raspberry Pi and just play that at a certain time?

Speaker B
Well, because I want to use my alarm clock that does the nice, like, 30 minutes, light fading thing while I.

Speaker A
Kind of thought that that was what the Raspberry Pi was doing. But that's the alarm clock.

Speaker B
No, this is its own alarm clock, which is really nice. I highly recommend it. So that's a constraint. So anyway, the project that I want.

Speaker A
To do right, okay. So that's two raspberry pi's. Now you're bringing a third into the house.

Speaker B
Yeah. The project I want to do is going to sound kind of familiar for people who've been listening to ATP, but I have a collection of CDs sitting by my stereo system in the other room. Right. And I have Sono speakers throughout my apartment. Right. And I have a problem where, like well, first of all, this is not a problem. I have a slight inconvenience where I'll occasionally I'll go to my CDs and be like, I want to listen to this CD. And then I either have to put the CD into a CD player and listen to it just in the one room or go through the Sonos app, which is still kind of clunky, and find the album I want to listen to and play it via Spotify or something. Exactly. Well, via or via my, like, music library, which I store on Plex because Icloud music library doesn't work.

Speaker A
Okay.

Speaker B
Which we talked about before.

Speaker A
All right.

Speaker B
Okay.

Speaker A
I'm going to leave that one. I'm going to let that one go.

Speaker B
I'm going to have a Raspberry Pi with an RFID or like, an NFC reader on it, just like, next to my stereo system, and I'm going to tag all my favorite CDs with tiny little NFC stickers that identify them. So when I want to listen to one, I just take the CD and hold it by this Raspberry Pi for a second, and then it'll start playing throughout my entire home on all the Sona speakers.

Speaker A
I like that. That's really cool.

Speaker B
It should be a lot of fun, right?

Speaker A
Yeah. That's age. I like that.

Speaker B
It's nice because with CDs or like, vinyl, it is nice to have that sort of physical way to at least browse through a music collection.

Speaker A
Right. I wonder what the latency on it.

Speaker B
Will be in terms of how long it takes to scan.

Speaker A
Right. So let's say if you pick it up and put it down, how long until you start hearing music?

Speaker B
I think 2 seconds.

Speaker A
2 seconds. But you haven't actually built it yet.

Speaker B
So you don't no, I've ordered the NFC reader and Raspberry Pi and everything.

Speaker A
Nice. That'll be really cool. I think it's a pretty neat project.

Speaker B
I think it will be. I'm super excited. It's solving a very minor inconvenience in my life.

Speaker A
Right.

Speaker B
It should be a fun project.

Speaker A
Yeah. I really want to get into the Raspberry Pi thing, but I haven't like I had one project I wanted to do and I never did it. And there was another one that I was thinking about recently. What was the other one? So the first one I wanted to do, I was trying to remember the other one, but I have me and Taylor's phones hooked up to Home Assistant through this app called Own Tracks. And what basically happens is Own Tracks, the app gets updated via like background location tracking and then sends that information back to Home Assistant. And it's kind of a convoluted system, but it does work. But then from there, what I wanted to do was I wanted to have a display in the house that says like, Sirous is currently wherever he is. And have I talked about the show before?

Speaker B
I don't think we've talked about it on the show, but I think you've.

Speaker A
Told this to me before I told you personally.

Speaker B
You're aiming for like well, I'll let.

Speaker A
You well, right, so it was supposed to look kind of like a train departures board and I looked into getting a real one and it's insanely expensive, like more than $10,000.

Speaker B
Yeah, I remember you telling me.

Speaker A
So that's kind of out. But I was going to get like a cheap LCD and just put it up there and then maybe use some CSS to style it like a travel board. And then as Taylor goes to work or if she goes to Atlanta to visit family or something like that, then it would update and then if I was traveling it would also update like, oh, sir, she's in the Lori side or Seruch is in Italy. If I'm there for a conference or.

Speaker B
Something, you could also make a do you remember the clock that the weasleys had in Harry Potter that shows like where everyone was?

Speaker A
Yeah, that was kind of the original idea. And somebody did build that with something like a Raspberry.

Speaker B
Oh really?

Speaker A
Yeah.

Speaker B
That's so cool.

Speaker A
Yeah, and then they had different hands for different people, pointed different places. So that's also like another yeah, that's kind of the genesis of the idea and I thought that might be nice. So you would ultimately need a Raspberry Pi if you do the LCD version because it has something has to drive that LCD. And I think a Raspberry Pi would be more than powerful enough and you.

Speaker B
Could be a Raspberry Pi. There are a bunch of mini computer things now that have like Intel Atom processors and are just tiny or you have a bunch. Of options for this.

Speaker A
Oh, I remember what it was. So I was reading some articles about the HomePod and about Amazon Lady in the Tube, that stuff. The article, it was like his Verge article that was like, I don't own my Echo dot. I am basically renting it from Amazon. He was listening to a podcast, and the Echo was like, okay, sorry, but I'm going to stop your podcast because I have to update and it just stopped a podcast, updated itself and then came back.

Speaker B
That's really annoying.

Speaker A
Insane. Please not can I listen to my podcast?

Speaker B
That's like a light switch rebooting while you're trying to use it.

Speaker A
Boy upset. But, yeah, I was reading this thing and I was like, that's kind of a good point. And sort of at the bottom of the article, he was like and I don't fully agree with this because there's no ethical consumption under capitalism or whatever, but he was like, we did this to ourselves by buying Google Homes and Echoes and stuff. And what we need to do is we need to maybe support an open ecosystem where the software is open source so we can look at it, make sure it's not spying on us, to where the skills that we write are all open source, where the hardware designs are open source. And then the end of the article is kind of like unfortunately, there is something like this, and it's called Microft. I think it's microft. AI.

Speaker B
Whoa.

Speaker A
What is that? So basically, it's a company where they make the hardware, and it kind of looks kind of like an Eve from Wally robot.

Speaker B
Yeah.

Speaker A
And the software is entirely open source, and you can run it on a raspberry pi.

Speaker B
Does it work?

Speaker A
I mean, sure, I think it doesn't have as many skills, but all the skills for Alexa and Google Home are written in that you've written it, you know, in JavaScript with Amazon lambda or whatever.

Speaker B
Yeah.

Speaker A
You could just point that anyone to a different infrastructure. It wouldn't be that hard.

Speaker B
It doesn't even be a different infrastructure, just something else has to call my lambda function.

Speaker A
Right, right, exactly. And then as long as those APIs are the same, like, hey, pronounce this word this way, or whatever, you could do it. And so you can I also want to know it's AI. What is the TLD for that?

Speaker B
That's a great question. You keep talking and I'll find out.

Speaker A
It's Angela in the Caribbean.

Speaker B
That was my next question, is, I'm a terrible American and I what's?

Speaker A
What's what's? What's? An Angela. Yeah, yeah, it's it's a little island in the Caribbean.

Speaker B
It looks there's some nice photos on Google Maps.

Speaker A
We'll put a link to Angela, population 15,000. That's very small. Yeah, it's supposed to be very nice. I don't know.

Speaker B
It looks warm there. Okay.

Speaker A
NR getting you down.

Speaker B
Well, it's up to 52 degrees now, actually. But it is raining.

Speaker A
Yeah, but you could ask Microsoft what the weather is. It's all open source and you could just install it anywhere you want. You can install it on a desktop. Like I could install on my Mac mini, but you could also put it on Raspberry Pi. You could put whatever microphones you wanted on it. That is way more appealing to me than getting an echo or a Google home.

Speaker B
This is pretty cool. And I say that as someone who has a couple of echoes. Yeah. Is this actually directions or estimate commute times?

Speaker A
Why not? Actually, estimating commute times is really, really easy with Google Maps. I mean, I've done it all in.

Speaker B
Apple Maps because this is what I've thought. I've thought a lot about getting an echo dot and hacking it to exist in my car. Right.

Speaker A
That's a real thing.

Speaker B
Yeah. And I think that people actually make things that are designed to do this. But I'm thinking I can't get an echo dot and then there'd have to be something that has a GPS chip and uses whatever APIs there are to update the address of the echo dot as I move so that I can ask, how long is it going to take me to drive home from here? Right, right. But maybe this is a better way to accomplish that.

Speaker A
That would be really interesting. I think that it would be too hard to constantly update the location of the Amazon Echo.

Speaker B
Maybe, but can I just make an API call every 30 seconds that reverse geocodes and address and then tells the echo this is where you live? Maybe, but this microft open source thing seems like the way to go about doing man, I'm so excited.

Speaker A
Isn't this cool?

Speaker B
I have to finish my other project before I start this because I have a bad habit of starting a lot of projects and never finishing them.

Speaker A
Yeah, during the club, I've been building.

Speaker B
An atomic clock for, like, the last year and a half years.

Speaker A
That's wild.

Speaker B
It's not as wild as Ebay. It's actually very straightforward.

Speaker A
Is it also on a raspberry pi?

Speaker B
No, that's going to be an Arduino based thing.

Speaker A
Nice.

Speaker B
It's not as interesting as it sounds because you can go on Ebay, go to ebay.com and search the address for Ebay, in case you didn't know. Go to Ebay and search for Rubidium. Oscillator or Rubidium. Frequency reference oscillator. Yeah. So that's the atomic part of an atomic clock. And then you just get an signal that you use to drive a timekeeping thing on the Arduino. That's pretty yeah.

Speaker A
The one sad thing about all this, like DIY whatever, is web services just do all this so much better. Like, this is never going to be better than an NTP or whatever.

Speaker B
Yeah. Oh, totally not. So, like a year and a half ago, I realized I need a clock for my living room. And I also realized I've always thought it would be cool to have an atomic clock. And so a year and a half later, I still don't have a clock, but I do have an oscillator and a power supply that I built up for it. Wow. Sitting on my desk over here. And if I turn it on and look at it with an Oscilloscope, I'm getting a pulse once every second.

Speaker A
That's pretty cool.

Speaker B
Basically, it's a clock.

Speaker A
Yeah, it's a clock without a display. Pretty simple.

Speaker B
Yeah.

Speaker A
Basically I looked into making, like, a weather station Raspberry Pi, but again, it's just never going to be better than but I don't think that's not what it's about. It's about making it yourself.

Speaker B
It's about having fun, doing the thing and learning. Right. That's why I do most of the stuff that I do is not because I'm going to make a better clock. It's because this seems like fun.

Speaker A
Right.

Speaker B
I'm going to learn stuff. Why not do it?

Speaker A
So minecraft there's a version one which kind of looks like a mid century modern alarm clock kind of thing. That's a really bad description, but whatever. And then they just launched the Mark Two, which I think the day this podcast comes out, it's going to be the end of the Kickstarter. Yeah. And they've raised like 300 grand, so it seems like a pretty real project. They've got some nice they they talk about the beam forming and some of the stuff that the HomePod does and that is cool.

Speaker B
And that's the sort of thing that you're never going to do yourself or I mean, I don't know, maybe some of our listeners will, but I don't know enough to put together a beam forming microphone already with a Raspberry Pi.

Speaker A
Yeah, you'd have to write a bunch of weird software that would be pretty hard to do. But, yeah, you can buy a pre built minecraft from them, or you can put it on your Mac mini or on your desktop or on your I.

Speaker B
Mean, I'm clearly going to put it on a Raspberry Pi with a GPS with onboard GPS and hide a microphone somewhere in my car.

Speaker A
Well, the other thing and then I.

Speaker B
Can ask how long it'll take to.

Speaker A
Drive home is super easy to like battery power or like cigarette lighter adapter power be really? Yeah.

Speaker B
It's such a cool little piece of hardware.

Speaker A
It is. I just wish I did something cool with it. I'm impressed that you've done you have some cool ideas. It's like anywhere that you think you want to put a computer, you can just put a Raspberry Pi.

Speaker B
Yeah.

Speaker A
There's like a Pi Zero, and that one is small enough to where it's basically the size of like a wall.

Speaker B
War tiny and it's cheap. The Pi Zero W, which is a version that has WiFi on board, is $10.

Speaker A
Yeah. God.

Speaker B
Like, granted you're gonna like pay another dollar for a little header that you have to solder on and you got to get a power supply and, like, an adapter for the mini HDMI port, because what uses HDMI?

Speaker A
Right.

Speaker B
But for something like my little NFC CD reader project, the size of this project is going to be dominated by the NFC reader. The Pi zero is going to be a tiny part of, like it'll be insignificant.

Speaker A
Yeah.

Speaker B
Which is just nuts.

Speaker A
Yeah.

Speaker B
And it's $10. And, like, you can there's so much computing power on on the tiny little board. It's so it's it's crazy what we can do it's. It's so cool.

Speaker A
How fast is it?

Speaker B
I don't remember.

Speaker A
I can look it up.

Speaker B
It's $10.

Speaker A
That's crazy.

Speaker B
It's a 1 GHz chip processor and 512 megabytes of Ram.

Speaker A
Yeah. I mean, this is a computer that we had on our desk ten years ago.

Speaker B
I remember building a 700 MHz PC, like, ages ago. And this little thing, this thing's $10.

Speaker A
Crazy.

Speaker B
How cool is that?

Speaker A
Pretty cool. Yeah.

Speaker B
So cool.

Speaker A
I got to do something with the raspberry pi.

Speaker B
You do. You really do.

Speaker A
Yeah. You want to wrap it up?

Speaker B
I guess we should wrap up.

Speaker A
I just want to give a shout out, as always, to the Patreon people. You all are awesome, and you make the show possible, and we couldn't appreciate you more.

Speaker B
Yes. Thank you so much. Esther said. Yeah, what else was there to say? We really appreciate you. Thank you for your support. Thank you for listening. I hope you enjoyed this Nerdy grab bag style episode and I'll talk to you next week.

Speaker A
Yeah. Talk to you soon, Chris.
