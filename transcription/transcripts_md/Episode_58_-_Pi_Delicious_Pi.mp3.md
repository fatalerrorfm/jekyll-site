Soroush Khanlou
Hey, buddy.

Chris Dzombak
Hey. How's it going?

Soroush Khanlou
Pretty good. What's up with you?

Chris Dzombak
Not a whole lot. Recording a podcast.

Soroush Khanlou
Oh, that sounds pretty good.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, it's great. You should try it. Should get into this podcast is going to be huge for I think it's going to be big. It's probably fad how's what I was.

Soroush Khanlou
Going to say, how's your week going? I guess your week just started, but how's your week been since the last time we talked?

Chris Dzombak
Ah, it's been good, man. What what happened in the last week? Yeah. I don't know. It's it's been pretty good. I feel like I've done a lot of stuff. I did a lot of social stuff this weekend. Saw Black Panther, which is good. You should go see it.

Soroush Khanlou
I have not seen Black Panther yet.

Chris Dzombak
I do recommend it.

Soroush Khanlou
Sorry.

Chris Dzombak
I definitely recommend it.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, I hear it's really, really good. I'm very excited about it. I tried to go today, but the theaters were all sold out. Today's Monday, President's Day in America.

Chris Dzombak
Okay.

Soroush Khanlou
And I didn't realize that everybody was off until I was, like, at the theater. It was sold out for the next four showings. That didn't wow.

Chris Dzombak
We just walked into a theater Saturday at 01:00 in the afternoon and bought, like, five tickets.

Soroush Khanlou
Wow.

Chris Dzombak
Was the theater packed or I mean, it was busy. It wasn't packed by any means. Other people around Ann Arbor have been having similar problems similar to you, like getting tickets. I don't understand how we managed to pull this off.

Soroush Khanlou
I guess have you heard about this new Movie Pass thing?

Chris Dzombak
I have a movie pass, in fact.

Soroush Khanlou
Oh, nice. There you go. I have a movie pass, too.

Chris Dzombak
I feel like we could really talk about this. It's a cool service. I've used it.

Soroush Khanlou
Let's explain. For people who don't know what it is, we got to bring the people with.

Chris Dzombak
You pay $10 a month, and you get to see movies for your $10 a month, subscription free.

Soroush Khanlou
You get to see one movie a day.

Chris Dzombak
You just see one two dimensional movie per day.

Soroush Khanlou
Right. It's stuck in two D. And I.

Chris Dzombak
Think the catch is that they sell all of the data about who's seeing what movies to movie studios, kind of.

Soroush Khanlou
I was actually listening to a podcast with a guy today. It was like, oh, really? It was recode media. I'll put it in the show notes if people want to listen. But basically it's kind of a genius thing. He was saying. When people first get it, they go crazy. They buy a bunch of movies, but then over time, they kind of taper off to about one movie a month.

Chris Dzombak
Okay.

Soroush Khanlou
And then the average ticket price in the country is about 850 or $9. So depending on who's using it and how much they kind of more or less break even the way that they make money. They can make money selling ads, but they can also make money making deals with the movie theaters and saying right now they're kind of basically holding up AMC. And they're saying, we deleted you from our app. And these I think they deleted ten of their theaters in really populated areas where there's a really easy alternative. So there's an AMC in Times Square and then across the street I think there's a Regal. And so they just deleted the AMC and they said, we're responsible for about 5% of their ticket sales for that location. And that's just like, wow, that's just like their loss. And they're saying everybody just goes across the street to the other movie theater. And so what they want is they are saying, we can fill up your movie theater for movies that are like, everybody's going to go see Star Wars, but they said, we can fill up your movie theater for the shape of water or whatever, and we want a small percentage of that. And of course AMC doesn't take kindly to terrorists or whatever trying to hold them up, stick them up for money, negotiate with that's. Right. And so they're basically like kind of in a standoff situation right now.

Chris Dzombak
I didn't realize that. I was totally under the impression it was a pretty straightforward like they basically break even on tickets and then sell data to studios operation.

Soroush Khanlou
You don't get that much information as the thing because all you get is the ability to track the user across different movie theaters. Just good, I guess. But I think they know that if you see Dr. Strange, you're probably also going to see Black Panther.

Chris Dzombak
I guess that's true. Especially with what advertising networks can do. They probably can tie people. They probably can gather profile information about you and tie that to the movies that you tend to see and maybe other viewing habits when you tend to go to see movies. Anyway, it's a cool service. I've seen more movies in the last two months since I signed up for this than I had seen probably in the three years before this combined.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. The other nice thing is I don't know how much movies cost in Ann Arbor, but here movie tickets, like 16 or $17. So you're more than paying for it if you see a movie every month.

Chris Dzombak
Movie ticket here is like eight to $10.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, that's like a normal price. But like, here is obviously crazy.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. New York. Greatest city in the world. Greatest city in the world. So did you get the new Movie Pass app update? Just recently?

Soroush Khanlou
I was actually on the beta for it. It's much better than the old version of the app.

Chris Dzombak
It is much better than the old one. The old one had not been updated for iPhone X and the navar not.

Soroush Khanlou
Being updated for the iPhone X is like the smallest of their problems. That was a tragedy.

Chris Dzombak
It was just a disaster. And I still do. Movie Pass is still on thin ice for me because that app was so terrible and because not this past weekend, but two weeks ago when this episode comes out, a couple of my friends and I had gone to see a movie, just like some Sunday morning, and we tried to use Movie Pass and it just didn't work. Just gave us an error. So we all bought our $8 movie tickets and went to see Movie anyway. But back to but defeats the like, I wouldn't have been there spending $8 if I had known I was going to have to spend $8.

Soroush Khanlou
Right, that's true.

Chris Dzombak
Anyway, how did we get down this road? The new app does look a lot better. The jury is still out, I think, on whether it actually works better or more reliably.

Soroush Khanlou
Right, yeah. It requires you to be within 100 yards of the theater, which I think is kind of annoying.

Chris Dzombak
Wasn't that the case before?

Soroush Khanlou
It's still the case.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah.

Soroush Khanlou
I was trying to use it today to go to see Black Panther.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, I don't know. That makes sense, I guess.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, it's fine. I wish it were more like my movie is in an hour or something. Like it was a different because 100 yards is just like, I kind of want to do it while I'm on the way to the theater or something.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. And my group of friends and I did. We also got burned, but just because for no reason other than we were at a bar drinking beer until past the time when we should have left to see the movie. And so we got to the theater we got to 100 yards from the theater as the time for the movie rolled around. And movies don't start until, what, 1520 minutes because of previews. But it disappears from Movie pass right when it says it's going to start the theater at 01:00. For a 01:00 movie, you're screwed.

Soroush Khanlou
Interesting.

Chris Dzombak
There is a button, which we found the hard way.

Soroush Khanlou
There is a button that you can say, I want to go to a movie that's not listed here.

Chris Dzombak
Oh, really?

Soroush Khanlou
I don't know how that in the old app.

Chris Dzombak
I don't know.

Soroush Khanlou
I saw it today, but I didn't need to use it, so I don't know how it works. It's also currently $8 a month, which is maybe worth canceling and re subscribing.

Chris Dzombak
Wait, really? Yeah, I think I'm paying $10 a month.

Soroush Khanlou
I'm paying ten, but it says, like, limited time offer, 8795 a month.

Chris Dzombak
Is that like perpetual?

Soroush Khanlou
Oh, sorry. Offer available to first time subscribers paid annually, so we couldn't get it anyway. And you have to pay annually.

Chris Dzombak
That's how they get you. Let's try to get you I'm not convinced enough that this is going to work, reliably to pay annually, in all honesty.

Soroush Khanlou
But they said they have like a million and a half subscribers, which is.

Chris Dzombak
That'S a lot of people, I think that they've been around for a while, but have grown really substantially over the.

Soroush Khanlou
Last yeah, a lot more expensive. It used to be like $40 a month and it was for people who see, like, crazy, crazy movies. Yeah, but now it's rich.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. I remember back at a I don't know, right around the holiday, right around Christmas, one of our friends told us about this and our minds were blown. And apparently he's had this card for a little while. I think a lot of people just learned about it over the last couple of months.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, it really blew up. I feel like I hear about it everywhere. I hear about it. I know on podcasts, like Fatal Error. I hear about it lots of places.

Chris Dzombak
He said the name of the show. Should we move on to a ten minute free adverb?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, it works pretty good if you watch movies. It's good. You should get it. It's america only. I know we have listeners abroad, but.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, sorry, I have a small mini.

Soroush Khanlou
Topic for us, if you're interested.

Chris Dzombak
I am interested.

Soroush Khanlou
I have an update on the Wimo situation in our household.

Chris Dzombak
So we're going to move from really talking up some service to talking about how bad something is.

Soroush Khanlou
Maybe, I don't know. Where do you think this topic is going to go?

Chris Dzombak
I have no idea. I guess I assume things have improved since apparently you still have Wimo equipment and Taylor hasn't made you get rid of it yet.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. Yes. So listeners of this show, remember episode 50, which is maybe the best episode we've ever done, the funniest, at least.

Chris Dzombak
I think our reactive episodes are pretty good.

Soroush Khanlou
That's true too. But either way, we brought my girlfriend on and the three of us talked about our home automation setup in our house. So after that show came out, I was kind of listening back to it and I was like, am I really just putting my girlfriend through this horrible experience? And is it really worth it? So what I did is I basically hung a little notebook. I hung a little notebook next to the Wimo that fails the most, and I just put a pen next to it and said, like, if it ever fails, just like, write down the date here and write down what happened. So we recorded this. Yeah, go ahead.

Chris Dzombak
Are you tracking the times that it works correctly, too?

Soroush Khanlou
No, I mean, I assume everything that's not labeled is working correctly.

Chris Dzombak
Well, yeah, but how do you know how frequently it's failing if you only record the error?

Soroush Khanlou
Well, we use it every day. I feel like, okay, it's the main light in the house. That is the button. Press, like, turn the house.

Chris Dzombak
All right, fair enough.

Soroush Khanlou
So, yeah, so I put this notebook there and we recorded the episode, I think in November, maybe. So it's been maybe three months, maybe four months since we recorded that was.

Chris Dzombak
Earlier than November, even I think.

Soroush Khanlou
Well, it was the end of season three either way. It's been a couple of months. It's been a couple of months. And I've learned two important facts. One is the failure mode that we thought we were experiencing the most, which is that you'd push the button and it wouldn't trigger the lights in the living room and the dining room has happened once in that entire time.

Chris Dzombak
Okay.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah.

Chris Dzombak
So are you seeing other failure modes then?

Soroush Khanlou
There's one other failure mode, which is that the Wimo periodically restarts itself, and while it's restarting, it's blinking green and you can't use it. And so it seems like it's inactive or whatever.

Chris Dzombak
Why does it need to reboot itself?

Soroush Khanlou
I don't know. I don't know. I've been talking to Remo support, but they don't know either. Yeah, so basically I've also been tracking that one, and that's happened maybe five or six times in the last three months, so not like a horribly high amount. And also it's like five or six times that it's been restarting while I've been pushing the button. Maybe it's restarting in the middle of the night, but I don't know because I'm not trying to turn on light in the middle of the night.

Chris Dzombak
Maybe this is just when they're issuing, like, firmware updates. Does it know?

Soroush Khanlou
The firm updates are done through the app, so that's specifically done.

Chris Dzombak
So is the takeaway here that it's actually working way more reliably than I was given to understand back in November.

Soroush Khanlou
What ended up happening was when it was failing a lot, it was because of a specific version of Home Assistant.

Chris Dzombak
Is the can you remind me what all Home Assistant does, please?

Soroush Khanlou
Home Assistant is like HomeKit on steroids, so basically it runs on a Mac mini or a Raspberry pi or whatever, and it's python, and you can just program everything into it so you can say, when I get home and the lights are off, do this. You can just write little scripts in YAML to do stuff. That's the YAML configuration file thing, if you remember that.

Chris Dzombak
Right? Yeah.

Soroush Khanlou
So it turns out that the version of that that was causing all of our problems once we downgraded to a version that worked and then they fixed the bug, and I think we eventually upgraded all the way back up, although I need to double check that. But once we got off the bad version, it just works pretty reliably.

Chris Dzombak
Okay, so your main problem turned out to be a bug, not with WeMo, but with the software you were using to do things with Wimo that WeMo doesn't let you do. Natively.

Soroush Khanlou
That's right.

Chris Dzombak
If I'm remembering right, you're using Home Assistant to group multiple lights together under one switch.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, it's because we have no lights in the living room and dining room, which are kind of connected, and there's no outlets that are controlled by light switches. So you would have to walk over there to turn it on. So what we end up doing is there's a foyer light. And so when you hit that button, it also triggers the living room and the dining room lights. And when it works, it's actually totally seamless. And, like, people who come in don't even know that there's, like, mac mini with running python making this happen, which is nice.

Chris Dzombak
This entire time, for the last several months, I've just been, like, walking into my apartment, flipping a light switch, and lights turn on and sighing. A Breath of Relief works 100% of the time. As a side note, you mentioned Raspberry Pi. And maybe after this, I have a fun Raspberry Pi project I'm going to do that we can chat about.

Soroush Khanlou
Nice. So that's half of the WeMo story. I could wrap this up. We could talk about Raspberry Pi's.

Chris Dzombak
Okay. What's the other half?

Soroush Khanlou
The other half is that WeMo finally launched their they call it a bridge. And what it is, is a small piece of hardware. It's like the size of a matchbox. Maybe maybe a little bit bigger. And it connects your home bridge. Sorry. It connects your home kit to your wimos. So now I can say, hey, siri, turn off the light in the office.

Chris Dzombak
Okay.

Soroush Khanlou
And now I'm sitting here in the dark.

Chris Dzombak
Oh, that seems great. And so are some of our listeners.

Soroush Khanlou
Well, if they have offices, turn the lights on in the office.

Chris Dzombak
Isn't, siri more like sensitive to tune to your voice these days? Specifically.

Soroush Khanlou
I think so. But I think it depends also on the device. I think the HomePod answers everybody. Oh.

Chris Dzombak
Do you have a HomePod?

Soroush Khanlou
I don't.

Chris Dzombak
Get one.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, probably not.

Chris Dzombak
We can talk about that later. Okay.

Soroush Khanlou
We mo. Bridge is working totally flawlessly. HomeKit is really good. Cool. I don't have any need for the automations because I can write way more advanced automations in home assistant, so I don't really worry about that. But getting to talk to Siri to use the lights is nice. So sometimes I'll be sitting and working on the computer and I'll realize that it's daytime, but haven't turned on the light yet. So instead of even moving my fingers from the mouse, I'll just tell the robot lady to turn on the lights. And it just does. And it's kind of nice.

Chris Dzombak
That is cool. Yeah.

Soroush Khanlou
So that's working pretty well as well. Basically, things are all right in the Wimo world. We got to bring Taylor on to validate everything that I've said, though.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, I'm not sure I totally believe you, but no, it sounds like things really have come together quite a lot, which is great. And I mean, as much as I joke about it, it is frustrating to have outlets that aren't controlled by light switches and just have no nice way to control those lights.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, it was pretty during the first few months we moved in, where it was just like you got to walk over. And what would end up happening more often than not is Taylor would come home from work and just sit on the couch in the dark. You deserve better than that.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. Okay, cool. So you're doing that on a Mac Mini?

Soroush Khanlou
Yes.

Chris Dzombak
Why did you choose out of curiosity, why did you choose Mac Mini instead of a Raspberry Pi?

Soroush Khanlou
So part of it is that I have a Mac Mini line around.

Chris Dzombak
All right, that's a strong argument.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. It's running my Plex for all my legally downloaded Internet.

Chris Dzombak
For your Linux ISO.

Soroush Khanlou
I stream my Linux ISOs off of that box. That's good. And then it's easier to work with because I don't have to SSH into it or find a monitor for it because it's always hooked up to the TV. It's a Mac, so I know how it works. I know how to make, like, auto launch scripts and stuff on. It just easier, basically. Okay, so tell me about you're thinking about a Raspberry Pi project.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, I have a Mac Mini here that runs Plex and runs a bunch of other things for me. I've running this I forget what it's called, but it's the software that turns my printer at home into an air print compatible thing. So I can print from my iPhone once a year. Nice. And I have a couple of Raspberry Pi's doing, like, fun and interesting things. One is like, monitoring or receiving tracking signals from aircraft around for, like, the 50 miles around my house.

Soroush Khanlou
Now, do you need a piece of hardware for that as well that has.

Chris Dzombak
A little, like, software defined radio USB dongle. It's like a $20 piece of hardware and then I have an antenna mounted in a window.

Soroush Khanlou
Software defined radio?

Chris Dzombak
Software defined radio, yeah.

Soroush Khanlou
How does that work?

Chris Dzombak
Well, you're really putting me in the spot here. You have radio chips that are really versatile and they can work across a very, very wide frequency range. And so rather than having hardware that is tuned to receive in a specific frequency range, and maybe you have some tuning hardware that can tune within, like the FM band that you might listen to. Right. Which is what, 87 to 108 MHz or so. You may have a software defined radio transceiver that can operate over a much, much wider range of frequencies. And it does this by, I think, at least for receiving with fancy, like, digital signal processing, basically on the radio waves that it picks up. That's probably a pretty poor introduction to it. But the upshot of it for projects like this is that you can get like a little cheap $20 dongle and work across huge frequency range, receive all sorts of signals, tune into your ham radio bands, you can tune into the FM radio that you would just listen to. You can listen to aircraft transmissions. Oh, that's another thing, is that with the software defined radio, you can tune into both Am and FM style transmissions rather than having hardware that limits you to just one of those two methods of radio communication. So it's a really versatile way to do radio, basically, right? Anyway, I have one of these set up to receive signals, what we call ADSB signals from aircraft that are around and share them to Flight Aware and Planefinder and a couple of other sites that collect this data and use it to power apps and other fun applications. That's part of what's powering my lady in a Tube skill so you can ask what aircraft are around. I have another Raspberry Pi in my apartment that is part of my alarm clock system, which okay, hold on.

Soroush Khanlou
You are not allowed to make fun of me for having computer light switches if you have a Raspberry Pi alarm clock.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, I mean, that's fair. So the Raspberry Pi is only part of the alarm clock, right? I have this clock that I have an alarm clock by my bed that is one of these alarm clocks that lights up slowly for like half an hour before you wake up. The idea is that it makes it helps wake you up in a more gentle fashion and it has an FM radio on it. So I thought it would be really cool if I could play a custom playlist on there instead of just tuning into NPR in the morning, because these days, the last thing I want to wake up to is the news. The news. And so I got a little raspberry pi. It's a raspberry pi. Zero. W the little $10 thing? And there's software you can run on it that is a total hack, but that uses some of the some of the digital input output systems on the processor to generate FM radio signals. And it's just powerful enough that if you attach an antenna to the board, you can pick it up from like a couple of feet away. Which is really cool because what this means is that I have a little raspberry pi sitting just, like, under my bed with a little antenna on it, and it just loops through. It's just a bash script. Script that loops through a directory of MP3 s on the raspberry pi and just continuously plays them over like an FM band. That's not used around here.

Soroush Khanlou
Wow.

Chris Dzombak
So what that means is that I.

Soroush Khanlou
Can'T believe I've been duped like this for so many years. I didn't know you do this, Chris.

Chris Dzombak
Oh, I totally do. So I can just open Transmit on my Mac and drop files in this folder and then they're just constantly, randomly being played, which means that whenever I set my alarm to, I just have, like, I come into this playlist at a random point.

Soroush Khanlou
Interesting. Is it just always streaming, this playlist?

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, you could just tune into this.

Soroush Khanlou
At any time of the day and it would be playing.

Chris Dzombak
Right. And this is how I get around the like, I don't have to coordinate the Raspberry Pi with, like, when I'm waking up, I just set the alarm clock for when I want to wake up. And there will be music. Right.

Soroush Khanlou
I don't want to break something that's already working, but maybe you could get another Raspberry Pi to play with. Why don't you just hook up a speaker to the Raspberry Pi and just play that at a certain time?

Chris Dzombak
Well, because I want to use my alarm clock that does the nice, like, 30 minutes, light fading thing while I.

Soroush Khanlou
Kind of thought that that was what the Raspberry Pi was doing. But that's the alarm clock.

Chris Dzombak
No, this is its own alarm clock, which is really nice. I highly recommend it. So that's a constraint. So anyway, the project that I want.

Soroush Khanlou
To do right, okay. So that's two raspberry pi's. Now you're bringing a third into the house.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. The project I want to do is going to sound kind of familiar for people who've been listening to ATP, but I have a collection of CDs sitting by my stereo system in the other room. Right. And I have Sono speakers throughout my apartment. Right. And I have a problem where, like well, first of all, this is not a problem. I have a slight inconvenience where I'll occasionally I'll go to my CDs and be like, I want to listen to this CD. And then I either have to put the CD into a CD player and listen to it just in the one room or go through the Sonos app, which is still kind of clunky, and find the album I want to listen to and play it via Spotify or something. Exactly. Well, via or via my, like, music library, which I store on Plex because Icloud music library doesn't work.

Soroush Khanlou
Okay.

Chris Dzombak
Which we talked about before.

Soroush Khanlou
All right.

Chris Dzombak
Okay.

Soroush Khanlou
I'm going to leave that one. I'm going to let that one go.

Chris Dzombak
I'm going to have a Raspberry Pi with an RFID or like, an NFC reader on it, just like, next to my stereo system, and I'm going to tag all my favorite CDs with tiny little NFC stickers that identify them. So when I want to listen to one, I just take the CD and hold it by this Raspberry Pi for a second, and then it'll start playing throughout my entire home on all the Sona speakers.

Soroush Khanlou
I like that. That's really cool.

Chris Dzombak
It should be a lot of fun, right?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. That's age. I like that.

Chris Dzombak
It's nice because with CDs or like, vinyl, it is nice to have that sort of physical way to at least browse through a music collection.

Soroush Khanlou
Right. I wonder what the latency on it.

Chris Dzombak
Will be in terms of how long it takes to scan.

Soroush Khanlou
Right. So let's say if you pick it up and put it down, how long until you start hearing music?

Chris Dzombak
I think 2 seconds.

Soroush Khanlou
2 seconds. But you haven't actually built it yet.

Chris Dzombak
So you don't no, I've ordered the NFC reader and Raspberry Pi and everything.

Soroush Khanlou
Nice. That'll be really cool. I think it's a pretty neat project.

Chris Dzombak
I think it will be. I'm super excited. It's solving a very minor inconvenience in my life.

Soroush Khanlou
Right.

Chris Dzombak
It should be a fun project.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. I really want to get into the Raspberry Pi thing, but I haven't like I had one project I wanted to do and I never did it. And there was another one that I was thinking about recently. What was the other one? So the first one I wanted to do, I was trying to remember the other one, but I have me and Taylor's phones hooked up to Home Assistant through this app called Own Tracks. And what basically happens is Own Tracks, the app gets updated via like background location tracking and then sends that information back to Home Assistant. And it's kind of a convoluted system, but it does work. But then from there, what I wanted to do was I wanted to have a display in the house that says like, Sirous is currently wherever he is. And have I talked about the show before?

Chris Dzombak
I don't think we've talked about it on the show, but I think you've.

Soroush Khanlou
Told this to me before I told you personally.

Chris Dzombak
You're aiming for like well, I'll let.

Soroush Khanlou
You well, right, so it was supposed to look kind of like a train departures board and I looked into getting a real one and it's insanely expensive, like more than $10,000.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah, I remember you telling me.

Soroush Khanlou
So that's kind of out. But I was going to get like a cheap LCD and just put it up there and then maybe use some CSS to style it like a travel board. And then as Taylor goes to work or if she goes to Atlanta to visit family or something like that, then it would update and then if I was traveling it would also update like, oh, sir, she's in the Lori side or Seruch is in Italy. If I'm there for a conference or.

Chris Dzombak
Something, you could also make a do you remember the clock that the weasleys had in Harry Potter that shows like where everyone was?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, that was kind of the original idea. And somebody did build that with something like a Raspberry.

Chris Dzombak
Oh really?

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah.

Chris Dzombak
That's so cool.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, and then they had different hands for different people, pointed different places. So that's also like another yeah, that's kind of the genesis of the idea and I thought that might be nice. So you would ultimately need a Raspberry Pi if you do the LCD version because it has something has to drive that LCD. And I think a Raspberry Pi would be more than powerful enough and you.

Chris Dzombak
Could be a Raspberry Pi. There are a bunch of mini computer things now that have like Intel Atom processors and are just tiny or you have a bunch. Of options for this.

Soroush Khanlou
Oh, I remember what it was. So I was reading some articles about the HomePod and about Amazon Lady in the Tube, that stuff. The article, it was like his Verge article that was like, I don't own my Echo dot. I am basically renting it from Amazon. He was listening to a podcast, and the Echo was like, okay, sorry, but I'm going to stop your podcast because I have to update and it just stopped a podcast, updated itself and then came back.

Chris Dzombak
That's really annoying.

Soroush Khanlou
Insane. Please not can I listen to my podcast?

Chris Dzombak
That's like a light switch rebooting while you're trying to use it.

Soroush Khanlou
Boy upset. But, yeah, I was reading this thing and I was like, that's kind of a good point. And sort of at the bottom of the article, he was like and I don't fully agree with this because there's no ethical consumption under capitalism or whatever, but he was like, we did this to ourselves by buying Google Homes and Echoes and stuff. And what we need to do is we need to maybe support an open ecosystem where the software is open source so we can look at it, make sure it's not spying on us, to where the skills that we write are all open source, where the hardware designs are open source. And then the end of the article is kind of like unfortunately, there is something like this, and it's called Microft. I think it's microft. AI.

Chris Dzombak
Whoa.

Soroush Khanlou
What is that? So basically, it's a company where they make the hardware, and it kind of looks kind of like an Eve from Wally robot.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah.

Soroush Khanlou
And the software is entirely open source, and you can run it on a raspberry pi.

Chris Dzombak
Does it work?

Soroush Khanlou
I mean, sure, I think it doesn't have as many skills, but all the skills for Alexa and Google Home are written in that you've written it, you know, in JavaScript with Amazon lambda or whatever.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah.

Soroush Khanlou
You could just point that anyone to a different infrastructure. It wouldn't be that hard.

Chris Dzombak
It doesn't even be a different infrastructure, just something else has to call my lambda function.

Soroush Khanlou
Right, right, exactly. And then as long as those APIs are the same, like, hey, pronounce this word this way, or whatever, you could do it. And so you can I also want to know it's AI. What is the TLD for that?

Chris Dzombak
That's a great question. You keep talking and I'll find out.

Soroush Khanlou
It's Angela in the Caribbean.

Chris Dzombak
That was my next question, is, I'm a terrible American and I what's?

Soroush Khanlou
What's what's? What's? An Angela. Yeah, yeah, it's it's a little island in the Caribbean.

Chris Dzombak
It looks there's some nice photos on Google Maps.

Soroush Khanlou
We'll put a link to Angela, population 15,000. That's very small. Yeah, it's supposed to be very nice. I don't know.

Chris Dzombak
It looks warm there. Okay.

Soroush Khanlou
NR getting you down.

Chris Dzombak
Well, it's up to 52 degrees now, actually. But it is raining.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, but you could ask Microsoft what the weather is. It's all open source and you could just install it anywhere you want. You can install it on a desktop. Like I could install on my Mac mini, but you could also put it on Raspberry Pi. You could put whatever microphones you wanted on it. That is way more appealing to me than getting an echo or a Google home.

Chris Dzombak
This is pretty cool. And I say that as someone who has a couple of echoes. Yeah. Is this actually directions or estimate commute times?

Soroush Khanlou
Why not? Actually, estimating commute times is really, really easy with Google Maps. I mean, I've done it all in.

Chris Dzombak
Apple Maps because this is what I've thought. I've thought a lot about getting an echo dot and hacking it to exist in my car. Right.

Soroush Khanlou
That's a real thing.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. And I think that people actually make things that are designed to do this. But I'm thinking I can't get an echo dot and then there'd have to be something that has a GPS chip and uses whatever APIs there are to update the address of the echo dot as I move so that I can ask, how long is it going to take me to drive home from here? Right, right. But maybe this is a better way to accomplish that.

Soroush Khanlou
That would be really interesting. I think that it would be too hard to constantly update the location of the Amazon Echo.

Chris Dzombak
Maybe, but can I just make an API call every 30 seconds that reverse geocodes and address and then tells the echo this is where you live? Maybe, but this microft open source thing seems like the way to go about doing man, I'm so excited.

Soroush Khanlou
Isn't this cool?

Chris Dzombak
I have to finish my other project before I start this because I have a bad habit of starting a lot of projects and never finishing them.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, during the club, I've been building.

Chris Dzombak
An atomic clock for, like, the last year and a half years.

Soroush Khanlou
That's wild.

Chris Dzombak
It's not as wild as Ebay. It's actually very straightforward.

Soroush Khanlou
Is it also on a raspberry pi?

Chris Dzombak
No, that's going to be an Arduino based thing.

Soroush Khanlou
Nice.

Chris Dzombak
It's not as interesting as it sounds because you can go on Ebay, go to ebay.com and search the address for Ebay, in case you didn't know. Go to Ebay and search for Rubidium. Oscillator or Rubidium. Frequency reference oscillator. Yeah. So that's the atomic part of an atomic clock. And then you just get an signal that you use to drive a timekeeping thing on the Arduino. That's pretty yeah.

Soroush Khanlou
The one sad thing about all this, like DIY whatever, is web services just do all this so much better. Like, this is never going to be better than an NTP or whatever.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah. Oh, totally not. So, like a year and a half ago, I realized I need a clock for my living room. And I also realized I've always thought it would be cool to have an atomic clock. And so a year and a half later, I still don't have a clock, but I do have an oscillator and a power supply that I built up for it. Wow. Sitting on my desk over here. And if I turn it on and look at it with an Oscilloscope, I'm getting a pulse once every second.

Soroush Khanlou
That's pretty cool.

Chris Dzombak
Basically, it's a clock.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, it's a clock without a display. Pretty simple.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah.

Soroush Khanlou
Basically I looked into making, like, a weather station Raspberry Pi, but again, it's just never going to be better than but I don't think that's not what it's about. It's about making it yourself.

Chris Dzombak
It's about having fun, doing the thing and learning. Right. That's why I do most of the stuff that I do is not because I'm going to make a better clock. It's because this seems like fun.

Soroush Khanlou
Right.

Chris Dzombak
I'm going to learn stuff. Why not do it?

Soroush Khanlou
So minecraft there's a version one which kind of looks like a mid century modern alarm clock kind of thing. That's a really bad description, but whatever. And then they just launched the Mark Two, which I think the day this podcast comes out, it's going to be the end of the Kickstarter. Yeah. And they've raised like 300 grand, so it seems like a pretty real project. They've got some nice they they talk about the beam forming and some of the stuff that the HomePod does and that is cool.

Chris Dzombak
And that's the sort of thing that you're never going to do yourself or I mean, I don't know, maybe some of our listeners will, but I don't know enough to put together a beam forming microphone already with a Raspberry Pi.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah, you'd have to write a bunch of weird software that would be pretty hard to do. But, yeah, you can buy a pre built minecraft from them, or you can put it on your Mac mini or on your desktop or on your I.

Chris Dzombak
Mean, I'm clearly going to put it on a Raspberry Pi with a GPS with onboard GPS and hide a microphone somewhere in my car.

Soroush Khanlou
Well, the other thing and then I.

Chris Dzombak
Can ask how long it'll take to.

Soroush Khanlou
Drive home is super easy to like battery power or like cigarette lighter adapter power be really? Yeah.

Chris Dzombak
It's such a cool little piece of hardware.

Soroush Khanlou
It is. I just wish I did something cool with it. I'm impressed that you've done you have some cool ideas. It's like anywhere that you think you want to put a computer, you can just put a Raspberry Pi.

Chris Dzombak
Yeah.

Soroush Khanlou
There's like a Pi Zero, and that one is small enough to where it's basically the size of like a wall.

Chris Dzombak
War tiny and it's cheap. The Pi Zero W, which is a version that has WiFi on board, is $10.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. God.

Chris Dzombak
Like, granted you're gonna like pay another dollar for a little header that you have to solder on and you got to get a power supply and, like, an adapter for the mini HDMI port, because what uses HDMI?

Soroush Khanlou
Right.

Chris Dzombak
But for something like my little NFC CD reader project, the size of this project is going to be dominated by the NFC reader. The Pi zero is going to be a tiny part of, like it'll be insignificant.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah.

Chris Dzombak
Which is just nuts.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah.

Chris Dzombak
And it's $10. And, like, you can there's so much computing power on on the tiny little board. It's so it's it's crazy what we can do it's. It's so cool.

Soroush Khanlou
How fast is it?

Chris Dzombak
I don't remember.

Soroush Khanlou
I can look it up.

Chris Dzombak
It's $10.

Soroush Khanlou
That's crazy.

Chris Dzombak
It's a 1 GHz chip processor and 512 megabytes of Ram.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. I mean, this is a computer that we had on our desk ten years ago.

Chris Dzombak
I remember building a 700 MHz PC, like, ages ago. And this little thing, this thing's $10.

Soroush Khanlou
Crazy.

Chris Dzombak
How cool is that?

Soroush Khanlou
Pretty cool. Yeah.

Chris Dzombak
So cool.

Soroush Khanlou
I got to do something with the raspberry pi.

Chris Dzombak
You do. You really do.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. You want to wrap it up?

Chris Dzombak
I guess we should wrap up.

Soroush Khanlou
I just want to give a shout out, as always, to the Patreon people. You all are awesome, and you make the show possible, and we couldn't appreciate you more.

Chris Dzombak
Yes. Thank you so much. Esther said. Yeah, what else was there to say? We really appreciate you. Thank you for your support. Thank you for listening. I hope you enjoyed this Nerdy grab bag style episode and I'll talk to you next week.

Soroush Khanlou
Yeah. Talk to you soon, Chris.
