Speaker A
Runtime H is maybe not the best thing to import, right? But I.

Speaker B
Wonder if I do import it anywhere. It was imported. The person that I adopted this project from was using associated types to associate a model object to a cell.

Speaker A
Which.

Speaker B
I did not like, especially because the cell was just a subclass that we own.

Speaker A
Like add properties to a subclass. Yeah, I was not one to shy away from using associated objects and rejective C, but that is not the right time to use one.

Speaker B
Yeah, so now I think there's no reference to Runtime H, so I think that's aces.

Speaker A
There was one time where I forget the details, but there was a table view involved in propagating different events from cells and I think yeah, I had involved the responder chain and associated objects on UI event somehow.
